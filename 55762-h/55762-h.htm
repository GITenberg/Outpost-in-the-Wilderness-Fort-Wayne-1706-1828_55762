<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>There was a time when the writer of local history and the academic
professional were two different people; indeed, one is almost tempted to
say, they were two different species. Fortunately for both, this is no
longer true. Many academic historians now recognize local units as the
fundamental units of historical study, presenting hard data in manageable
quantities for precise conclusions. Charles R. Poinsatte was among
the first to recognize this and merge the academic and local traditions of
historical writing, the one supplying rigor and judgments based on cosmopolitan
learning, and the other supplying the vividness and appeal of
the familiar and relevant.</p>
<p>On the academic side, Charles R. Poinsatte got his undergraduate
and graduate education at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend.
Thomas T. McAvoy schooled him to precision in judgment and exhaustiveness
in research. Poinsatte also had the good fortune to study under
Aaron I. Abell, a student of Arthur Schlesinger, Senior, whose 1933
book, <i>The Rise of the City, 1878-1898</i>, initiated a new kind of American
history. Professor Abell first got Poinsatte interested in what is now
called urban history. In fact, however, Poinsatte&rsquo;s career embodies still
another great tradition in American historiography, that of frontier history
as inspired by Frederick Jackson Turner. <i>Frontier Outpost</i> describes
the <i>site</i> of an urban area to be, but it is not truly urban history, as Dr.
Poinsatte&rsquo;s book, <i>Fort Wayne during the Canal Era, 1828-1855</i> (Indiana
Historical Bureau, 1969), was. Thus Dr. Poinsatte writes in this book of
Fort Wayne as an aspect principally of the history of the Old Northwest.</p>
<p>Higher education at Notre Dame, acquaintance with a student of
the elder Schlesinger, and thoughts spurred by the Turner thesis are only
part of the story, of course. The area Dr. Poinsatte decided to study was
Fort Wayne and not Detroit or Chicago or Cincinnati. Here what
Nathaniel Hawthorne called &ldquo;a sort of home-feeling with the past&rdquo;
worked its magic. Born in Fort Wayne in 1925, Charles Poinsatte was
stirred by the names he heard as a boy, Little Turtle, Anthony Wayne,
and George Rogers Clarke. Some family property was part of the old
Richardville estate, and in his youth he explored an old Indian burial
ground there. He has never gotten over his fascination with those men,
and now he examines them with his academic tools.</p>
<p>Dr. Poinsatte has always been able to reconcile seemingly conflicting
movements in American historical writing. Urban history and frontier
history, he argues, are in many ways complementary, for frontier
<span class="pb" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
historians can explain to urban historians why the entities they study are
located where they are and how they got their start. Likewise, local history
and history as most often written by academic professionals benefit
from cross-fertilization. Local history always needs to be written from a
broad perspective which keeps the local historian from claiming unique
status for developments which took place in many other localities at the
same time. Likewise, in-depth studies of certain localities provide tests
for the larger generalizations of academic historians, generalizations that
are too often based on unrepresentative samplings of evidence from national
elites and large cultural and political centers like New York and
Washington.</p>
<p>Still, one suspects it is the excitement of particular locality&rsquo;s history
which accounts for Dr. Poinsatte&rsquo;s work. It has already taken him
to England and France in search of the records and documents which
explain the early history of Fort Wayne. He intends to return to Europe
next year to explore still another aspect of history suggested by Fort
Wayne&rsquo;s story, the lives of French military officers who fought in the
American Revolution. After that, he might consider a history of Fort
Wayne in the railroad era, from 1855 (where Dr. Poinsatte&rsquo;s work on
the canal era ended) to the Progressive Era. Whatever the course of Professor
Poinsatte&rsquo;s future studies, Fort Wayne&rsquo;s citizens will look forward
to reading the results. He has already enriched our understanding of ourselves
beyond measure.</p>

<h2><span class="small">Preface</span></h2>
<p>Early Fort Wayne played an important and definite role in the
history of the old Northwest. Its unique position as a portage site between
the Wabash and Maumee rivers made the Wabash route one of
the natural waterways from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi river
and brought Indians and fur traders to this spot at an early date. It is
most likely the oldest continuous site settled by white men in Indiana.
During the French, British, and American occupation of the region,
forts were built here as outposts of defense in the Indian country.
Its strategic importance was recognized in all the plans for military
campaigns in the area between the Great Lakes and the Ohio
river for almost a century. Here was located at a later date an important
government Indian agency, and to the town on certain days of
the year flocked hundreds of Indian traders. Fort Wayne was also
situated in the heart of the rich Maumee-Wabash fur producing region.</p>
<p>While giving a comprehensive background of the French and
British occupation of the site of Fort Wayne, I have stressed its importance
in the early days of American settlement. The gradual decline
of the fur trade, followed by the removal of the Indian agency
in 1828 and the opening of the area to white settlement by the Indian
treaties of that decade, all combined to usher in a new era in the history
of Fort Wayne. By the 1830&rsquo;s the people of Fort Wayne were
feverishly making plans for the Wabash and Erie canal. This opened
a new period in Fort Wayne&rsquo;s history which has been studied in my
previous work.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Since then the development of the city has been
consistent and substantial.</p>
<p>From the modern growing city it is a far cry back to the time of
the Miami Indians and the old fort in the wilderness with its little
garrison of men puzzled at times, no doubt, to understand their
choice of a life of loneliness in an environment which gave little opportunity
for the refinements of life. The people of today are none
too thoughtful of their obligation to the pioneer soldier, trader and
settler. It is my hope that in addition to contributing to the annals of
the Old Northwest, this work may create a deeper appreciation of
these early builders. At the same time it has been my desire to treat
all these people objectively rather than in the fictitious way of the
sentimentalist.</p>
<p>Previous histories dealing with the early history of Fort Wayne,
while furnishing valuable material, have either been incomplete or
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
inaccurate, chiefly because many primary sources were not available
to the writers or were not known to exist. I have made extensive use
of primary material found in the Burton Collection at Detroit, the
Chicago Historical Library, and the Fort Wayne Public Library as
well as in the British Museum and the Public Records Office in London
and the <i>Archives des Colonies</i> in Paris. Part of the European research
was made possible by a summer grant from St. Mary&rsquo;s College,
Notre Dame, Indiana.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments are due to many individuals who have so
kindly given assistance, especially to the staffs of the various archives
and libraries which I have used in Chicago, Detroit, Paris, and
London. Mr. Albert Diserens, chief of the Indiana collection of the
Fort Wayne Public Library, aided me in every way. A special debt is
due to the officers and members of the Allen County-Fort Wayne
Historical Society and in particular Mr. Fred Reynolds who assisted
immeasurably in arranging for the publication of this work. To the
late Reverend Thomas T. McAvoy of the University of Notre Dame I
owe deep gratitude for first encouraging me to study the history of
my hometown.</p>
<p>While almost all early American cities which originated as military
outposts later changed their names&mdash;Cincinnati (Fort
Washington). Chicago (Fort Dearborn)&mdash;or simply dropped &ldquo;fort&rdquo;
from their titles&mdash;Defiance, Ohio&mdash;for some reason the citizens of
Fort Wayne never followed this common practice. The old &ldquo;Fort
Wayne&rdquo; fell into ruins, but the name survives. Undoubtedly few
individuals have even wondered why, but I believe, or would like to
believe, that somehow the later citizens of Fort Wayne wanted to retain an
identity with the past&mdash;a past that is worth knowing and remembering. It
is to these citizens&mdash;past and present and to my own family that I dedicate
this book.</p>

<br />The French and British Period</h2>
<p>To know the history of any town is to know the significance of its
geographical position. This is particularly true of the early history of
Fort Wayne (Known to the Indians as Kiskakon or Kekionga<a class="fn" id="fr_1_1" href="#fn_1_1">[1]</a> and to the
French and English as Fort Miami). Therefore, it is necessary to explain
the significance of the site of Fort Wayne in an era of exploration and
trade when wilderness was king and waterways were the arteries of
communication. The story of Fort Wayne begins as the history of the
Maumee-Wabash portage. Located at the confluence of rivers, St.
Joseph and St. Mary&rsquo;s, which together form the Maumee or Miami of
Lake Erie, Fort Wayne is situated at the northeast starting point of the
seven mile portage to the Little River, (see map on <a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>) Twenty-two
miles southwest of Fort Wayne, the Little River joins the Wabash,
which, in turn, empties into the Ohio and then into the Mississippi. The
Maumee-Wabash portage was from the early seventeenth century until
the mid-nineteenth century a vital overland link that tied together the
great waterway systems of the St. Lawrence and Mississippi. In other
respects the site of Fort Wayne was at the &ldquo;crossroads&rdquo;. From this
point the traveler could journey northeast up the St. Joseph river into the
present state of Michigan, or turn southeast up the St. Mary&rsquo;s river into
the central portion of the present state of Ohio. This, then, is the significance
of the words of Little Turtle, the great Miami chief, who once
called the site of Fort Wayne, &ldquo;that glorious gate ... through which all
the good words of our chiefs had to pass from the north to the south,
and from the east to the west.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_2" href="#fn_1_2">[2]</a></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Of the five great portage routes used by the French,<a class="fn" id="fr_1_3" href="#fn_1_3">[3]</a> the
Maumee-Wabash was the last to be exploited, for, unlike the more
northern routes, it was along the line of &ldquo;most resistance&rdquo;. The
Iroquois warfare in this region and as far west as the Illinois country
made it virtually impossible for the French to use the routes extending
through southern Lake Erie. With the establishment of the French posts
along the lower Mississippi, however, the Maumee-Wabash portage
gained importance, as it proved to be the shortest route connecting the
settlements of New France (Canada) and Louisiana. The first white man
to use this portage may have been some unknown French &ldquo;coureur de
bois&rdquo;, pursuing his lawless life of adventure and fur-trading. There is
some claim that LaSalle used the Maumee-Wabash portage in his explorations
of 1670 or later, but it is based, for the most part, on conjecture
and is still open to various interpretations.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_4" href="#fn_1_4">[4]</a> In any event, LaSalle&rsquo;s description
of the territory between Lake Erie and Lake Michigan indicates
a familiarity with the region, and it was he who first directed the attention
of the French to this portage by pointing out the way to shorten the
route to the lower Ohio river.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_5" href="#fn_1_5">[5]</a> Whatever LaSalle&rsquo;s plans were for opening
up this easy channel of communications<a class="fn" id="fr_1_6" href="#fn_1_6">[6]</a> they had to be abandoned because
of the failure of the French to appease the Iroquois. This powerful
confederacy had all but annihilated the Erie Indians earlier in the century
and were now pressing their attacks upon the western tribes south
of Lake Michigan. Out of fear of the Iroquois the area of Indiana was
largely abandoned by the Miamis and other related tribes. Therefore by
the 1670&rsquo;s, when LaSalle set out to achieve his great objective, control
of the Mississippi for the French, he found it necessary &ldquo;to go to the Illinois
[river] through the lakes Huron and Illinois [Lake Michigan] as
the other routes which I have discovered by the head of Lake Erie and
by the southern shore of the same, have become too hazardous by frequent
encounters with the Iroquois who are always on that shore.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_7" href="#fn_1_7">[7]</a>
That this route had become &ldquo;too dangerous&rdquo; is indicated by the letter of
Jean de Lamberville to Count de Frontenac on Sept. 20, 1682, in which
he expressed his fears that &ldquo;an Iroquois army, twelve hundred strong
... would completely annihilate the Miamis and their neighbors the Siskakon
[Kiskakon] and Ottawa tribes on the headwaters of the
Maumee.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_8" href="#fn_1_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The events which took place near the turn of the eighteenth century
completely altered the situation for the French in this region. Differences
between the Fox Indians, located west of Lake Michigan, and the
French alienated the former entirely. The result was to compel the
French to seek a more direct line of communication with the Mississippi
settlements than by the Wisconsin river-Lake Michigan route, and to encourage
them to promote the trade in the less remote posts. This new
policy was inaugurated by Cadillac&rsquo;s plan to establish a post at Detroit,
which met with the Crown&rsquo;s approval and was carried out in 1701. At
the same time, the French were able to conclude a temporary peace with
the Iroquois and to induce the pro-French tribes of Miamis to begin
migrating eastward and to re-establish themselves at the headwaters of
the Wabash and Maumee rivers. This migration of the Miamis was a
gradual process and can be traced from northern Illinois and southern
Wisconsin around the head of Lake Michigan to their old settlements on
the Wabash, Maumee, and Miami rivers. The Miamis were persuaded to
move for a number of reasons&mdash;the hostility of the Fox Indians, the advantages
in trade and protection furnished by their proximity to Detroit,
and finally the abundance of fur, especially beaver, to be found in the
area south and southwest of Lake Erie. By 1712, the Miamis had taken
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
possession of the entire Wabash valley,<a class="fn" id="fr_1_9" href="#fn_1_9">[9]</a> and the country as far eastward
as the Big Miami river. Their principal village, Kiskakon, was situated
where the present city of Fort Wayne now stands. Of the northern tribes
the Miami confederacy was second only to that of the Iroquois. Father
Marquette paid them high tribute, while LaSalle described them as &ldquo;the
most civilized of all nations of Indians&mdash;neat of dress, splendid of bearing,
haughty of manner, holding all other tribes as inferiors.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_10" href="#fn_1_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Other tribes came to the Ohio valley about the same time. The
Wyandots established themselves along the southern shore of Lake Erie
about 1701. The Shawnee, a southern tribe, settled principally in the
lower Scioto valley around 1730, while the Delaware were to be found
in the Muskingum valley by 1750. A small group of Ottawas were located
on the Auglaize river, a tributary of the Maumee, about fifty miles
northeast of Kiskakon. The importance of this small tribe rests in their
famous chief, Pontiac, and his &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; against the English in
1763. Altogether these tribes numbered about 15,000 people. For the
most part, they were friends of the French, although at times they expressed
discontent.</p>
<p>Grasping the new importance of the Maumee-Wabash trade route
after 1712, the officials of New France were quick to suggest to the
crown the construction of a chain of posts from the head of the Maumee
to the mouth of the Wabash in order to protect this increasingly vital
line of communication between Canada and Louisiana, and, equally,
important, to counteract the English ever pressing closer to the Indians
in the upper Ohio valley.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_11" href="#fn_1_11">[11]</a> The idea was not new, as LaSalle had
suggested such a policy to the home government previously, but the
time was now ripe. Economic reasons for establishing these posts were
not lacking. Fear of the English meant fear of their participation in the
fur trade, which was exceedingly valuable in this area. Wild life had increased
abundantly during the years of Iroquois warfare when the region
was practically uninhabited. A French memorialist, writing at this
time, pointed out that the New York traders, through the medium of the
Iroquois agents, secured between 80,000 and 100,000 beaver skins annually
from the area south and southwest of Lake Erie.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_12" href="#fn_1_12">[12]</a> This almost
equalled the amount taken annually from the whole of the land north of
the Great Lakes. Cadillac, the founder of Detroit, reported in 1707 that
the Maumee valley was &ldquo;the finest land under heaven&mdash;fishing and
hunting are most abundant there.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_13" href="#fn_1_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>The revitalized village of Kiskakon became the location of one of
the earliest posts established in the French chain along the Maumee-Wabash
route, and was known as Post or Fort Miami. The exact year of
the founding of Port Miami by the French is uncertain. Although some
writers believe the post was established as early as 1680 or 1686,<a class="fn" id="fr_1_14" href="#fn_1_14">[14]</a>
there is no evidence to support such suppositions. Some confusion
seems to arise from a misinterpretation of those French colonial documents
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
which refer to the Fort Miami built by LaSalle at the mouth of
the St. Joseph river of Lake Michigan, and not, as these writers believed,
to the Fort Miami at the headwaters of the Maumee. A careful
reading of these documents is necessary in each instance to determine
which Fort Miami is meant. About the same time that the eastward migration
of the Miamis began 1697 Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes,
was appointed attache to the Miamis.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_15" href="#fn_1_15">[15]</a> At first he was obviously at
the Miami fort on the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan, although, as
the Miami village, Kiskakon, grew in importance, Vincennes found it
increasingly necessary to visit the Miami village from 1702 to 1719. It
is possible that in 1706 he built a small post primarily for trading purposes
at Kiskakon.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_16" href="#fn_1_16">[16]</a> By 1715 a new element, the English fur trader had
entered the picture and Vincennes, as well as the French colonial government,
was convinced that it was no longer feasible to encourage the
Indians to migrate eastward. From Kiskakon, Vincennes reported to the
royal officials that the English of Carolina were having recourse to
every sort of expedient to persuade the Miamis to join them against the
French.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_17" href="#fn_1_17">[17]</a> The increased English efforts to gain footholds in the Wabash
and Maumee valleys, determined Vincennes upon a course of action approved
by the Marques de Vaudreuil, governor of Canada. Vincennes&rsquo;
plan called for the removal of the Miamis at the headwaters of the
Maumee to a new center on the St. Joseph river of Lake Michigan, near
the present city of South Bend.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_18" href="#fn_1_18">[18]</a> It is possible that the plan might have
succeeded as Vincennes was &ldquo;much loved&rdquo; by the Miamis; however,
with his death at Kiskakon in 1719, the Miamis &ldquo;resolved not to move
to the River St. Joseph, [but] to remain where they are&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_19" href="#fn_1_19">[19]</a> The Miamis
preserved for a long time the memory of Vincennes. Thirty years after
his death, Celeron de Bienville, while urging a group of Miamis to return
to Kiskakon, used the name of Vincennes to work upon their
minds, speaking of him as the one &ldquo;whom you loved so much and who
always governed you, so that your affairs were prosperous.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_20" href="#fn_1_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>On hearing of the Miamis&rsquo; decision, Governor de Vaudreuil resolved,
with the approval of the Council of Marine, to establish a strong
post at the headwaters of the Maumee. For this purpose he sent Captain
Dubuisson, the former commander at Detroit, who had already achieved
success on one occasion with the Miamis, to build the fortifications.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_21" href="#fn_1_21">[21]</a>
Finished in May, 1722, the fort was located on the right bank of the St.
Mary&rsquo;s at a latitude later given by Father Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps
(professor of hydrography at the Jesuit college of Quebec who visited
Fort Miami in 1749) as 41 degrees, 29 minutes. Other information
Father de Bonnecamps gives indicates that the fort was about one-half
mile down the river from the Maumee-Wabash portage road.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_22" href="#fn_1_22">[22]</a> Writing
the Council of Marine on October 24, 1722, de Vaudreuil stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The log fort Fort Miami which he Dubuisson had build is the finest in
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the upper country. It is a strong fort and safe from insult from the
savages. This post which is of considerable worth ought to have a
missionary. One could be sent there in 1724 if next year the council
will send the four Jesuits which I ask.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_23" href="#fn_1_23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unlikely that the priest requested was ever stationed at Fort Miami,
as there is no indication from the <i>Jesuit Relations</i> or other sources of one
being here, although it is possible that some missionaries visited this
spot on occasion.</p>
<p>Fort Miami proved of value to the French for various reasons. After
its construction, it soon became a military post of consequence, with a
garrison of twenty to thirty men.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_24" href="#fn_1_24">[24]</a> It was the policy of the French to locate
their garrisons and trading posts wherever there existed a sufficiently
large village of friendly Indians or wherever the strategic importance
of a place itself made it necessary to erect a fort. Fort Miami
combined both of these advantages. Once the Miamis determined to remain
at Kiskakon, they would benefit the French not only by their fur
trade but would be a means of protection against hostile tribes and the
English. The strategic position for a fort at the Maumee-Wabash portage
was recognized even by the English as early as 1717.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_25" href="#fn_1_25">[25]</a> Pouchet, a
French historian, writing shortly after the French and Indian War was of
the opinion that the French would have been wiser to have strengthened
their fortifications in the Miami region than establish their line of defense
in the upper Ohio.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_26" href="#fn_1_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps Fort Miami&rsquo;s greatest importance was as a center of French
activity among the Indians. Being at the principal village of the Miami
confederacy, this outpost was used as a counter-balance to the English
intrigue from New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas. It is
to be noted that Dubuisson was sent to Kiskakon &ldquo;to counteract the effect
of all those Belts it [the Miami nation] was but too frequently receiving
and which, as they caused eight or ten Miami canoes to go this
year to trade at Orange, might finally induce all that nation to follow
their example.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_27" href="#fn_1_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>In 1734, the Sieur de Noyelles was entrusted with the task of
gathering the scattered Miamis in their village, where they would be
protected from English intrigue. In this affair he was seconded by the
Sieur Darnaud who was in command at Fort Miami.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_28" href="#fn_1_28">[28]</a> The French had
good reason to fear the English trader, who had strong economic advantages.
The goods furnished by the English in exchange for the furs of
the Indians were produced more cheaply than the French items. Also
British virtual control of the sea trade meant these goods were transported
for less. Finally rum one of the principal factors in the English
trade was produced in the colonies, while the French traders had to import
brandy from the mother country. As early as 1716, de Vandreuil
reported to the Council of Marine that the Iroquois were sending belts to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
the Miamis and Ouiatenons, an allied tribe on the Wabash, to induce
them to seek the necessities of life at the English post on the &ldquo;Oyo
river&rdquo;. Here the Indians were offered merchandise &ldquo;a half cheaper than
among the French.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_29" href="#fn_1_29">[29]</a> The following year the king replied through the
Council that he was well pleased to learn that M. de Vincennes, apparently
at Kiskakon, had prevented the Miamis and Ouiatenons from accepting
the belts of the English. His majesty hoped that the sending of
scarlet cloth would turn the savages away from the English trade.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_30" href="#fn_1_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Other accounts show the wide-spread influence the French maintained
from Fort Miami. There were considerable outlays for the savages
in food, merchandise, and the repairing of arms. From here important
chiefs were sent to conferences in Detroit and Montreal, with interpreters
and guides and all expenses paid. One Miami chief, Cold Foot, was
paid handsomely for his loyalty in putting an end to a hostile movement.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_31" href="#fn_1_31">[31]</a>
The expenses for messengers were especially numerous during
the year&rsquo;s 1748-1749, when English influence was particularly active.
Between December 25, 1747, and July 25, 1748, 1,894 livres were
spent at Fort Miami for presents for the Indians.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_32" href="#fn_1_32">[32]</a> The high expenditures
at Fort Miami of those years, of which we have records, gives
some indication of the value the French ascribed to the post at the
Maumee headwaters. Some years the annual expenses for the Indians at
Fort Miami almost equalled those of Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_33" href="#fn_1_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Fort Miami had its economic &ldquo;raison d&rsquo;etre&rdquo; as the center of the
thriving fur trade of the surrounding region. The furs were brought
westward from the northwestern and central parts of the present state of
Ohio, as well as northward from the Wabash valley, and eastward from
the Illinois country. In his &ldquo;Memoir of 1757&rdquo;, Bougainville points out
that the Miami post, like many of the French posts, was one &ldquo;removed
from free commerce&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_34" href="#fn_1_34">[34]</a> That is, Fort Miami was leased for a period of
three years to the commandant or &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; who secured exclusive
rights to the fur trade. The price of the lease was twelve hundred livres
per year. Moreover the farmer was charged with the cost of the presents
to the savages as well as the wages of the interpreters. There were extraordinary
expenses, however, that the government paid. For instance,
Sieur Charly, the farmer at Post Miami in 1747, collected 2,007 livres
for the use of twenty-four horses by a party of Indians being led to Detroit
for conferences.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_34a" href="#fn_1_34a">[34a]</a> These expense accounts had to be approved by
the governor and the &ldquo;intendant&rdquo;, the financial representative of the
crown, who oftentimes scaled the figures down as they saw fit. An
example of a most drastic reduction is found in the case of a bill of
Sieur Charly for December, 1744. In this instance, Hocquart, the royal
intendant moderated the bill from 1,491 livres to 100 livres.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_35" href="#fn_1_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>In an ordinary year there issued from Fort Miami 250 to 300 packages
of furs. These furs were shipped by way of Detroit to Montreal,
as Fort Miami by its geographical position belonged politically and
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
economically within the colony of New France rather than Louisiana.
Nevertheless, by its proximity to the Wabash there was frequent communication
and trade with the Louisiana settlements, particularly Vincennes
and those of the Illinois country. For example, in 1749, 200
livres were paid at Fort Miami to Jean Baptiste Riddey de Bosseron,
&ldquo;voyageur&rdquo; who had just returned from the Illinois country.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_36" href="#fn_1_36">[36]</a> Grain
and livestock were sent to Fort Miami from the French settlements along
the lower Wabash and Ohio rivers. For this reason the price of corn,
flour, and beef was generally lower at Fort Miami than at Detroit and
the northern posts such as Michilimackinac.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_37" href="#fn_1_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>The Maumee-Wabash portage became the scene of increased activity
as the French and English rivalry in the upper Ohio country grew
more tense during the decade preceding 1756. From the year 1719 when
ten canoes of Miami Indians passed down the Maumee on their way to
Albany, New York, with furs and returned with firearms, ammunition,
and trinkets, the English endeavored to bring the Miamis under their influence.
During the 1740&rsquo;s, there was a notable expansion of English
trade with the Indians of this region. Twice&mdash;in 1739 and again in 1744&mdash;the
French commander of Detroit, M. de Longueuil, led strong expeditions
along the Maumee-Wabash against British traders on the White
river near the center of the present state of Indiana. While he succeeded
in his immediate objective, this display of military power no longer held
the Indians in check. In 1747, the Wyandot chief, Sanosket, also known
as Nicolas, under the influence of the English led an uprising against the
French. The Miamis at Kiskakon believing that Detroit had been captured,
set fire to Fort Miami and captured the eight men within the stockade
at the time.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_38" href="#fn_1_38">[38]</a> The temporary commander, Ensign Douville, was at
Detroit when the Indians committed the pillage. He had been sent to the
Miamis in order to invite them to a conference at Montreal, and two of
their chiefs, Cold Foot and Porc Epic had accompanied him as far as
Detroit when they received the news that the post had been taken.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_39" href="#fn_1_39">[39]</a>
Douville journeyed on to Montreal alone, while Ensign Dubuisson hastened
to Kiskakon with the two chiefs and a force of some sixty men,
&ldquo;with a view to deprive the enemy [the British] of the liberty of seizing
a post of considerable importance.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_40" href="#fn_1_40">[40]</a> Dubuisson found the fort and
buildings only partially destroyed, but he was able to do little more than
hold his position, without attempting to repair the place.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1748, Dubuisson returned to Detroit leaving Captain
Charles DeRaymond in charge of the post, which Father de Bonnecamps,
arriving the next year, described as being &ldquo;in a very bad condition&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_41" href="#fn_1_41">[41]</a>
DeRaymond was probably the most colorful figure to command
Fort Miami during the French period. He had been one of the
chief proponents of the policy of destroying the English influence in the
Ohio, as he saw the danger of tolerating the English traders in the
Miami region. In a memoir he presented in 1745 he gives one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
best analyses of the whole Ohio question from the French point of
view.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_42" href="#fn_1_42">[42]</a> Writing from Fort Miami in 1747 to the crown, he pointed out
that had the growth of English influence been checked immediately, the
uprising under Nicolas could never have occurred.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_43" href="#fn_1_43">[43]</a> Now in command
of a partially ruined fort, DeRaymond had good reason to fear further
trouble. Although the Miamis had given assurances of loyalty after the
arrival of Dubuisson, most of them under the leadership of a Miami
chief, &ldquo;La Demoiselle&rdquo; (so termed because of his fondness for dress
and ornaments) had moved to Pickawillany, an English trading post on
Loramie&rsquo;s Creek at the start of the portage to the St. Mary&rsquo;s river,
northwest of the present town of Piqua, Ohio.</p>
<p>The French, determined to make a strong impression on the savages
of the Ohio country, and to find out the true conditions existing
there, sent the veteran officer, Pierre Joseph Celoron Celoron, Sieur de
Bienville, with a force of 230 men down to the Great Miami river.
Journeying up the later river to its headwaters, Celoron stopped at the
village of &ldquo;La Demoiselle&rdquo; and urged the Miamis to return to Kiskakon.
Celoron was disappointed bitterly when the wily &ldquo;La Demoiselle&rdquo;
would merely promise to return to Kiskakon sometime in the future.
Crossing the portage to the St. Mary&rsquo;s, Celoron&rsquo;s expedition continued
up that river to Fort Miami. Here they stopped only long enough to buy
provisions and canoes to continue to Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_44" href="#fn_1_44">[44]</a> Celoron and Father de
Bonnecamps, the chaplain and hydrographer of the expedition, found
the energetic DeRaymond dissatisfied with his &ldquo;decaying&rdquo; fort.
Moreover, he &ldquo;did not approve the situation of the fort and maintained
that it should be placed on the bank of the St. Joseph, a scant league
from the present site.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_45" href="#fn_1_45">[45]</a> DeRaymond wished to show them the spot that
he had selected for the new fort and obtain their opinion of it, but Celoron
was in haste to depart. DeRaymond received some consolation from
the fact that Father de Bonnecamps, an expert, could trace a plan for the
proposed fort.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_46" href="#fn_1_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>Early in the year 1750, DeRaymond completed the new fort on the
left bank of the St. Joseph. It stood on rather high ground (at the present
St. Joe Boulevard and Delaware Avenue), less than a mile from the
junction of the St. Joseph and St. Mary&rsquo;s.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_47" href="#fn_1_47">[47]</a> Chief Cold Foot, a staunch
friend of the French, occupied the discarded buildings of the old fort,
which became the center of an Indian settlement known as Cold Foot
Village. Half a mile to the south of the new fort, where the Maumee
turns in its course toward the east, lay the village of Kiskakon. Most of
its inhabitants had joined the English at Pickawillany. Writing to Governor
LaJonquiere in September, 1749, DeRaymond reported that the attitude
of all the nations was very bad and apparently was becoming
worse.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_48" href="#fn_1_48">[48]</a> Again in 1751, he reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My people [the French traders] are leaving me for Detroit. Nobody
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
wants to stay here and have his throat cut. All of the tribes who go to
the English at Pickawillany come back loaded with gifts. I am too
weak to meet the danger. Instead of twenty men, I need five hundred....
The tribes here are leaguing together to kill all the French....
This I am told by Cold Foot, a great Miami chief, whom I think an
honest man.... If the English stay in this country, we are lost. We
must attack and drive them out.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_49" href="#fn_1_49">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to the distress of the French, a smallpox epidemic in the winter
of 1751, carried away many of the inhabitants of Cold Foot&rsquo;s Village,
including their good friend, Cold Foot, and his son.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_50" href="#fn_1_50">[50]</a></p>
<p>That not all of the French traders at Fort Miami were scurrying to
Detroit is evident from the fact that in the year 1750 one of the most
noted traders of the area, Joseph Drouet de Richerville, came to Kiskakon.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_51" href="#fn_1_51">[51]</a>
Richerville was a scion of French nobility who either was seeking
a life of adventure or was engaged in the fur trade for the mere sake
of a livelihood, as the family wealth had dwindled. Shortly after his arrival,
Richerville married Tahcumwah, the daughter of the reigning
Miami chief, Aquenochqua, and sister of the future chief, Little Turtle.
Tahcumwah was later known as Marie Louisa,<a class="fn" id="fr_1_52" href="#fn_1_52">[52]</a> apparently the name
she received in baptism. All who came in contact with her at a later
date speak of her as a clever and intelligent woman, and it was largely
through her efforts that her son, Jean Baptiste de Richerville, arose to
such high prominence as the last civil chief of the Miamis.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_53" href="#fn_1_53">[53]</a></p>
<p>The arrival of Joseph Drouet de Richerville at Fort Miami was an
isolated case, however, and what DeRaymond had said of the traders
leaving for Detroit remained true. In all likelihood, DeRaymond, despite
his zeal, was glad to be relieved in 1751 by a new commandant, Neyon
De Villiers. De Villiers had hardly assumed command when an English
trader, John Pathin, was captured within the fort itself. As France and
England were then at peace, Governor George Clinton of New York
demanded an explanation of the incident. The French governor, the
Marquis de la Jonquiere, replied sharply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The English, far from confining themselves within the limits of the
King of Great Britain&rsquo;s possessions, not satisfied with multiplying
themselves more and more on Rock River ... have more than that
proceeded within sight of Detroit, even unto the fort of the
Miamis.... John Pathin, an inhabitant of Willensten,
has been arrested in the French fort of the Miamis by M. de Villiers,
commandant of that post ... he entered the fort of the Miamis to persuade
the Indians who remained there, to unite with those who have
fled to the beautiful river [the Ohio.] He has been taken in the French
fort. Nothing more is necessary.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_54" href="#fn_1_54">[54]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A short time later, two men of de Villiers&rsquo; garrison were scalped by
&ldquo;La Demoiselle&rsquo;s savages.&rdquo; Indeed the English seem to have laid claim
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
to the very fort itself, for on Mitchell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Map of North America&rdquo;,
drawn in 1755, Fort Miami is referred to as &ldquo;the Fort usurped by the
French&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_55" href="#fn_1_55">[55]</a></p>
<p>In June, 1752, a French and Indian force, coming by way of the
Maumee and St. Mary&rsquo;s rivers, fell on Pickawillany, completely destroying
the English post, so annoying to the French at Fort Miami.
Four years later, during the French and Indian War, Lieutenant Bellestre,
the commandant of Fort Miami, led a party of 25 French and 205
Indians from his post to the head of the James River, where they captured
a blockhouse and some ten Virginia &ldquo;Rangers&rdquo;. After his release,
one of the captives, Major Smith, proposed to lead a force of 1,000
woodsmen and a sufficient number of Indians across the Ohio and over
the Shawnee trail from old Pickawillany to Fort Miami and then on to
Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_56" href="#fn_1_56">[56]</a> Although nothing came of Major Smith&rsquo;s plans, the site of the
future Fort Wayne was to figure prominently in all the military campaigns
north of the Ohio river for the next half century, that is throughout
the dramatic events marked by Pontiac&rsquo;s conspiracy, the American
Revolution, the Indian wars, and the War of 1812.</p>
<p>When de Vaudreuil, governor of Canada, capitulated at Montreal in
1760, he issued orders for the surrender of the posts&mdash;Michilimackinac,
Detroit, Green Bay, St. Joseph, Ouiatenon, and Miami&mdash;as dependencies
of Canada.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_57" href="#fn_1_57">[57]</a> On November 29, 1760, Detroit was surrendered to
Major Robert Rogers in command of the &ldquo;Rangers&rdquo;. Eight days later,
Lieutenant John Butler with a detachment of twenty men set out from
Detroit to receive the formal transfer of Fort Miami from the French
commander, thus bringing to an end French rule at the headwaters of
the Maumee.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_58" href="#fn_1_58">[58]</a></p>
<p>Although of strategic importance, Fort Miami never became more
than a military outpost and trading center during the French period of
occupation. Father de Bonnecamps wrote in 1749 of the French village
in and around the fort, &ldquo;The French there number twenty-two; all of
them ... had the fever ... There were eight houses, or to speak more
correctly, eight miserable huts which only the desire of making money
render endurable.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_59" href="#fn_1_59">[59]</a> &ldquo;The desire of making money&rdquo; is of course a reference
to the fur trade, the only occupation, outside of the military, of
those French living there. The large Indian villages surrounding the fort
naturally brought the trader and soldier, but, at the same time, this uncertain
element of Indian friendship probably excluded any sizable
French settlement. Whatever the reasons we must conclude that, unlike
Vincennes, Fort Miami did not attract any type of French settler, outside
of those connected with the fur trade.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Butler of the &ldquo;Rangers&rdquo; had been chosen by Col.
Henry Bouquot to receive the surrender of Fort Miami since he could
speak French and seemed &ldquo;very intelligent&rdquo;. He had orders to hold the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
post, as it was of great importance to Detroit and being at the &ldquo;carrying
place of nine miles into the waters of the Ouabache Wabash ... it would
prevent a surprise in the Spring.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_60" href="#fn_1_60">[60]</a> Lieutenant Butler found the savages
destitute and sent a French trader to Fort Pitt for the necessary supplies.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_61" href="#fn_1_61">[61]</a>
In the spring, Butler was relieved by Ensign Robert Holmes, who
was destined to become one of the first victims of the Indian uprising of
1763, known as &ldquo;Pontiac&rsquo;s conspiracy&rdquo;. Ironically, Holmes was also
one of the first to learn of the impending danger and passed the information
on to Major Gladwyn, the English commander at Detroit, adding,
however, &ldquo;this affair is very timely stopt&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_62" href="#fn_1_62">[62]</a> A month later he allowed
himself to be lured from the fort by a false request on the part of his Indian
mistress to aid a sick Miami woman. Holmes was instantly killed
by the savages concealed nearby, and the small garrison surrendered
upon the demand of Jacques Godefroy and Money Chene, two Frenchmen
who were implicated with the Miamis in the scheme. Godefroy,
after leading another successful attack on Ouiatenon, journeyed to Sandusky
where he fell into the hands of Colonel Brandstreet who had arrived
from Niagara with a large force to quell the uprising. Godefroy
had been a prominent citizen of Detroit and had taken the oath of allegiance
to the British crown; consequently, he expected death at the
hands of the British. Instead he was given his freedom on condition that
he would guide and protect an English officer, Captain Thomas Morris,
who was being sent to the Illinois Indians by way of the Maumee. Captain
Morris, was a man of culture and literary tendencies. Being such,
he kept an excellent diary of experiences, which he was later persuaded
to publish.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_63" href="#fn_1_63">[63]</a></p>
<p>Almost any man would have failed in an attempt to go through
hundreds of miles of hostile Indian country, and Captain Morris was no
exception. Having journeyed up the Maumee as far as Kiskakon, Morris
met such a dangerous reception at this place that he was forced to turn
back. In fact he was fortunate to escape with his life, as the Indians intended
to burn him at the stake, and he was saved by the intercession of
Godefroy and the young chief Pecanne. Morris was also befriended
within the fort by two French traders, Capucin and L&rsquo;Esperance and a
Jewish trader, Levi. L&rsquo;Esperance concealed the English officer within
his house until it was safe for him to leave. Captain Morris, despite the
ill-treatment by the Indians, clearly saw the reason for their dissatisfaction.
He observed that the French policy, or custom, of intermarriage
with the Indians had been more beneficial than that of English, as the
Indians felt that they and the French were one people. Moreover, he
noted that the French prohibited, &ldquo;the sale of spiritous liquors to Indians
under pain of not receiving absolution; none but a bishop [could] absolve
a person guilty of it.&rdquo; He went on to point out, &ldquo;This prevented
many mischiefs too frequent among the unfortunate tribes of savages
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
who are fallen to our lot.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_64" href="#fn_1_64">[64]</a></p>
<p>The failure of Captain Morris to get past Kiskakon, demonstrated
beyond doubt that as long as the Indians at this spot were unfriendly,
they could prevent any intercourse with those tribes to the south and
southwest. Consequently, Colonel George Croghan, a famous English
trader in the Ohio valley, was sent to the Maumee-Wabash area to
pacify the tribes. Croghan was received with a display of enthusiasm by
the Indians at Kiskakon, who hoisted an English flag he had given them
at Fort Pitt. Croghan reported as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Twightwee village [the English called the Miamis &ldquo;twightwees&rdquo;]
is situated on both sides of a river called St. Joseph. This river where
it falls into the Miami [Maumee] river about a quarter of a mile from
this place is one hundred yards wide, on the east side of which stands
a stockade fort, somewhat ruinous. The Indian village consists of
about forty or fifty cabins, besides nine or ten French houses, a
runaway colony from Detroit during the late Indian war; they were
concerned in it, and being afraid of punishment came to this post,
where ever since they have spirited up the Indians against the English.
All the French residing here are a lazy indolent people, fond of
breeding mischief ... and should by no means be suffered to remain
here.... The country is pleasant, the soil rich and well watered.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_65" href="#fn_1_65">[65]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Croghan&rsquo;s judgment of the French at Kiskakon seems rather harsh,
although his opinion of the French at Vincennes is no better. Apparently
in the eyes of the austere English and colonists, the more carefree life of
the French &ldquo;habitants&rdquo; of the western posts seemed to be an indication
of indolence on the latter&rsquo;s part.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_66" href="#fn_1_66">[66]</a> Furthermore, it is difficult to explain
why the same French people who had saved the life of Captain Morris
in the previous year would now be &ldquo;spiriting up&rdquo; the Indians against
the English, especially since Pontiac&rsquo;s plans had collapsed. On the other
hand, it was not to be expected that these French people would immediately
cast aside all hostility toward their recent enemies. By 1765,
it is likely that these French traders, weary of the warfare that had
ruined their business, were ready to assume a neutral attitude, while the
Indians themselves grudgingly came to terms with the English.</p>
<p>From the day Fort Miami fell to Pontiac&rsquo;s Miami allies in 1763
until General Anthony Wayne built the American fort on the side of the
modern city of Fort Wayne in 1794, there was no permanent<a class="fn" id="fr_1_67" href="#fn_1_67">[67]</a> garrison
stationed at the headwaters of the Maumee. Over this period of thirty-one
years&mdash;during which time the American nation came into being&mdash;the
region of which we speak gradually became the rendezvous of a defiant
mixture of Indian warriors and lawless renegades of the frontier,
such as the Girties. It was also the home of a heterogeneous population
of English and French traders and their families, French &ldquo;engages&rdquo;,
and Miami, Delaware, and Shawnee tribes. In 1790, General Harmar&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
men counted seven distinct villages in the immediate area. All together,
they formed a considerable settlement or settlements, known
near the end of the Revolution as the Miami Towns, the Miami Villages,
or simply, Miamitown. In a sense such a place was the forerunner
of the lawless frontier towns of the next century.</p>
<p>In 1772, Sir William Johnson, in charge of Indian affairs in
America, pointed out to the British government the advisability of reoccupying
and strengthening the Miami post, as it was &ldquo;a place of some
importance&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_68" href="#fn_1_68">[68]</a> Since the Indians were pacified, the home government
for the sake of economy, did not see fit to carry out his suggestion at
the time. A memorandum of the same year speaks of the &ldquo;fort being
inhabited by Eight or Ten French families&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_69" href="#fn_1_69">[69]</a> A census, apparently
taken in 1769 by the English, lists the names of nine French families
living at Fort Miami.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_70" href="#fn_1_70">[70]</a> These French residents were nearly all traders,
though some of them had been located here for many years. By 1772,
most of them were willing to accept the friendship of their former foes,
the English&mdash;primarily for mercenary reasons. British policy kept the
colonists from occupying the land north of the Ohio, which meant the
preservation of the Indian fur trade. Moreover practically all their furs
were sold through the London market. Thus, with the outbreak of the
American Revolution, the French traders at Fort Miami felt they had
more to lose by being friendly with the American cause than their
neighbors, the French inhabitants of Vincennes and the Illinois settlements
who were primarily interested in farming.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_71" href="#fn_1_71">[71]</a></p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Revolution, British troops could not be
spared for the post at Miamitown, but it was placed under strict supervision
by Lieutenant-Governor Henry Hamilton at Detroit. Hamilton appointed
Jacques Lasselle, an officer in the Canadian militia, to the
super-intendency of this post as an agent of Indian affairs. Lasselle arrived
with his family in 1776 from Montreal.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_72" href="#fn_1_72">[72]</a> His duties were to see
that the Indians maintained their active friendship for the British cause
and to check the passports of all persons going from Detroit to the
Wabash and lower Ohio.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_73" href="#fn_1_73">[73]</a> None but those holding a license issued by
the British authorities were permitted to engage in trade.</p>
<p>The year that brought Lasselle to Miamitown gave also to the region
Peter LaFontaine and Charles (John?) Beaubien from Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_74" href="#fn_1_74">[74]</a> Both
settled in the Spy Run area of modern Fort Wayne. In his marriage with
a Miami woman and the identification of his interests with those of the
Indians, LaFontaine declared his loyalty to the red men. LaFontaine&rsquo;s
grandson, Francis LaFontaine, was the last chief of the Miamis to hold
any real authority over the tribe. To Charles Beaubien there attaches
greater interest. He was very active in the English cause and was a
favorite of both Hamilton and Major Arent S. DePeyster, who succeeded
Hamilton as Lieutenant-Governor of Detroit. From Miamitown,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Beaubien, with a young Frenchman named Lorimer and a band
of some eighty Indians, made a raid into Kentucky, where they captured
an American party under Daniel Boone at Blue Licks in 1778. In the
same year he served as a scout for Hamilton&rsquo;s army, preceding it to
Vincennes. DePeyster, in 1780, proposed to recall all the traders, but
Beaubien, from Miamitown. Because of his pro-British activities, Beaubien
was cordially hated by the people of Vincennes, who &ldquo;wish[ed] to
hang&rdquo; him.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_75" href="#fn_1_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>On September, 26, 1778, Hamilton received from Beaubien at
Miamitown the first news that Colonel George Rogers Clark and his
Virginians had taken Vincennes.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_76" href="#fn_1_76">[76]</a> Hamilton prepared for his ill-fated
expedition to Vincennes by ordering the militia to prepare the
Maumee-Wabash portage route and strengthen the defenses at
Miamitown. Supplies, valued at $50,000, were left there to be sent to
Vincennes later. Concerning the portage, Hamilton wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The waters were so uncommonly low that we should not have been
able to have passed but that at the distance of four miles from the
landing place the beavers had made a dam which kept up the water;
these we cut through to give passage to our boats.... The beaver are
never molested at that place by the traders or Aberigines, and soon
repair their dam.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_77" href="#fn_1_77">[77]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clark constantly thought the capture of Detroit to be his ultimate goal in
the northwest campaign. The first step in his proposed expedition was to be the
reduction of Miamitown; however, he was prevented from making any move
toward Miamitown and Detroit, as he lacked men and supplies. While the subject
was still fresh in the minds of the inhabitants along the lower Ohio, another
individual made his appearance to undertake what even the daring Clark considered
imprudent. This man was Augustus Mottin de LaBalme, a lieutenant-colonel
in the French cavalry who had come to America to offer his services to
the colonies. In July, 1777, he was commissioned inspector general of cavalry
by Congress, but feeling himself slighted in not being placed in command of
that division of the army, he resigned in October and engaged in private business.
Late in the spring of 1780, he was sent west to arouse the French in Illinois.
The antipathy of the Indians and French toward the Virginians hindered
him a great deal and in order to accomplish his purpose, he abandoned the Virginians
and promised the French and Indians that royal troops of France would
soon be on the Mississippi.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_78" href="#fn_1_78">[78]</a></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>At Vincennes and Kaskaskia he gathered a force to lead against
Miamitown, with the ultimate objective being Detroit. Four hundred men were
to have joined him at Ouiatenon, but as these reinforcements did not appear, he
was obliged to strike at Miamitown on November 3, 1780, with but 103 men,
before the news of the expedition reached there. The initial blow was successful
as the traders and Indians were taken by surprise and barely had time to flee the
village. The Lasselle family was forced to escape by way of the Maumee, and
in their haste, their small daughter was drowned. LaBalme&rsquo;s men fell to plundering
the traders&rsquo; goods and Indian villages, then retired to Aboite creek, a few
miles to the southwest. Beaubien and LaFontaine, whose goods had been destroyed,
incited the Indians to attack LaBalme, as the Indians, learning the
party was French, were not disposed at first to retaliate. The red men, led by
their famous war chief, Little Turtle, in his first major engagement, completely
defeated LaBalme&rsquo;s force, all but a few being either killed or captured. LaBalme
himself was killed and his personal papers, along with the news of the
victory, were sent to DePeyster at Detroit. Among these papers was the intelligence
LaBalme had gathered about Miamitown and its traders. The goods at
Beaubiens&rsquo; store, which was &ldquo;kept by Mr. LaFontaine, and old man&rdquo; was valued
at 50,000 livres. Another store, kept by Mr. Mouton, a partner of Beaubien,
was also valued at 50,000 livres. These goods were &ldquo;equally well disposed&rdquo;
to &ldquo;Mr. Barthelemy [listed in the census of Fort Miami in 1769], Mr.
Rivard, Mr. Lorrance, Mr. Gouin of Detroit, Mr. Lascelle [Lasselle?], Mr. Pottevin,
Mr. Paillet, Mr. Duplessy, &amp; others ... &amp; an American called George, a
partner of Israel [possibly the Jew, Levi, who aided Captain Morris in
1764].&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_79" href="#fn_1_79">[79]</a></p>
<p>DePeyster was thoroughly alarmed upon learning of LaBalme&rsquo;s expedition,
and he immediately dispatched the &ldquo;Rangers&rdquo; to Miamitown with orders to
cover the cannon there, until it was possible to send them to Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_80" href="#fn_1_80">[80]</a> Captain
Thompson of the &ldquo;Rangers&rdquo; reported to DePeyster on March 14, 1781, that he
was taking immediate action to alter the old fort. A false rumor that the French
of Vincennes were heading for Miamitown, brought the Indians flocking to their
villages. Their spirit was very high, and several times they asked Captain
Thompson for assistance &ldquo;to go and destroy Post St. Vincent, as it is the only
place that gives them any uneasiness.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_81" href="#fn_1_81">[81]</a> Within a year, however, DePeyster
reported that the Miamis and other tribes in the area were growing fearful of
being too closely allied with the British.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_82" href="#fn_1_82">[82]</a> It is possible that they had received
some information concerning Cornwallis&rsquo; surrender at Yorktown.</p>
<p>The treaty of Paris in 1783, which formally brought to an end the Revolutionary
War, transferred the sovereignty of the land south of the Great
Lakes to the United States. Actually this transfer made little impression on conditions
at Miamitown, for, in truth, the Revolution in the West closed only with
the Jay and Greenville treaties. Great Britain, in violation of the treaty of Paris,
continued to hold Detroit together with other posts along the southern shore of
the Lakes. By this means they maintained effective control of the fur trade of
the Northwest, and, thereby, to a great extent, influenced the Indians. Just how
much the British officials were responsible for the Indian warfare from 1783 to
1794 is a debatable question. At times the action of the British officials seems
to have been a case of the right hand not letting the left hand know what it was
doing. Most present-day students of the subject are inclined to acquit the British
government of any positive agency in the matter. They point out that the constant
warfare injured the fur trade of the area which was in a state of decline
during this period anyway.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_83" href="#fn_1_83">[83]</a> Nor did the Indians need much encouragement to
take the warpath, as the ever-increasing tide of immigration coming down the
Ohio and across the mountains threatened to engulf them. But the American settler
did not reason this way; to him the English government was responsible.
Milo Quaife, historian of the Northwest, correctly observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The present day scholar, possessing sources of information denied to
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
contemporaries and entire immunity from the gory scalping knife and
tomahawk, may consider the subject calmly and philosophically; the
American borderer&rsquo;s opinions were based upon the acts of Great Britain&rsquo;s
agents in America and the visible facts of the situation on the

<p>A concrete example of the condition of the Indian fur trade and
warfare during this period and their connection with the British trader
and his government is given in the history of Miamitown between 1783
and 1794. Strong evidence indicates that despite the general decline in
the fur trade, the region southwest of Detroit, and Miamitown especially,
was extremely important for the British fur trade. In 1790, the
British commander at Detroit, Major Smith, wrote to his superiors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How far the loss of the Miamis Country, to the protection of His
Majesty, will effect this Post and its trade, is a matter it would be
presumptive in me to comment on. I think it however my duty to observe
that it is a considerable mart of Indian Commerce uniting in
this place.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_85" href="#fn_1_85">[85]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month later Dorchester, Governor of Canada, warned the authorities
in London that the loss of Miamitown to the Americans would
bring grave hardships to the trade at Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_86" href="#fn_1_86">[86]</a> In an earlier document he
had estimated that 2000 packs of furs were taken yearly from the Miami
region, bringing an income of some 24,000 pounds sterling. This far
exceeded any other area south of the Great Lakes, doubling in fact the
number of packs taken from the next most important area, that from Detroit
north to Lake Huron.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_87" href="#fn_1_87">[87]</a></p>
<p>In the heart of the Indian country, Miamitown was also the principal
point from which the Indian raiding parties harassed the frontier.
Twenty-six war parties left Miamitown in a period of six months during
1786.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_88" href="#fn_1_88">[88]</a> There is a strong tradition and some evidence to show that a
secret society of Miami warriors of necessary courage and cunning met
at stated intervals at Miamitown for the purpose of burning a captive
and eating his flesh.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_89" href="#fn_1_89">[89]</a> By its proximity to Detroit, Miamitown remained
within the British orbit of trade. The merchants at Miamitown formed a
loose association for their mutual benefit called the &ldquo;Society of the
Miamis&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_90" href="#fn_1_90">[90]</a> Business was carried on not only with Detroit and other
English controlled stations, but also with Vincennes and the Illinois settlements,
until Indian warfare and the animosity of the American settlers
toward the traders made it virtually impossible to go to the lower
Wabash.</p>
<p>Low market prices, bad fur seasons, and almost constant warfare
by the Indians threatened to ruin the fur trade in the years immediately
following the Revolution. Many of the small companies failed and the
larger ones had difficulties. David Gray, a prominent trader at
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Miamitown, was advised not to come to Detroit, as his creditor, William
Robertson, was awaiting Gray&rsquo;s arrival.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_91" href="#fn_1_91">[91]</a> The previous year, 1785,
the same Gray had been requested to aid in collecting a long-standing
debt from two of his fellow villagers, Rivard and LaBerche.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_92" href="#fn_1_92">[92]</a> Larimier,
another trader at Miamitown, failed because he could not meet the
claims of his creditors.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_93" href="#fn_1_93">[93]</a> There was constant danger that the British
traders might lose all the export trade of the region to the Spanish at
New Orleans. In 1787, the &ldquo;Society&rdquo; found it necessary to send &ldquo;the
Grandmaster to Vincennes to keep the trade from going to New Orleans.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_94" href="#fn_1_94">[94]</a>
The Indians were also an uncertain quantity and at times were
hostile even to the traders. Chapeau, a member of the &ldquo;Society&rdquo;, was
killed by the Indians and George Ironside reluctantly told Gray at Vincennes
to send the goods to New Orleans rather than risk shipping them
up the Wabash.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_95" href="#fn_1_95">[95]</a> Gray was repeatedly warned by Ironside to be most
cautious on his return trip to Miamitown as he was in danger of losing
his life. It is to the credit of the Miamitown traders that they traded only
sparingly in liquor with the Indians. Their reasons were not altogether
altruistic, however, as the price of liquor was exceptionally high.</p>
<p>The most candid description of the character of the trade at
Miamitown has been left to us by Henry Hay, who wrote in his journal
of 1790:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... but few skins comes in, and almost every individual (except the
engages) is an Indian trader, everyone tries to get what he can either
by fowle play or otherwise&mdash;that is by traducing one another&rsquo;s characters
and merchandise. For instance by saying such a one has no Blankets
another no strowde or is damned bad or he&rsquo;ll cheat you &amp; so
on&mdash;in short I cannot term it in a better manner than calling it a Rascally
Scrambling Trade &amp;c &amp;c.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_96" href="#fn_1_96">[96]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry Hay, the writer, was an English trader and partisan who
sojourned in Miamitown for a period of four months during the winter
of 1789-90. His day-by-day account, obviously not intended for publication,
gives us a cross section of life at Miamitown in all its aspects,
both civilized and savage. Hay seems to have been in the employee of
William Robertson, the Detroit merchant, although there is good reason
to believe that he was also employed by Major Murray, the English
commander at Detroit. Set off against the hard life of a trading post
among Indian villages was the characteristic vivacity and gaiety of the
French atmosphere prevalent in the town. The daily routine was by no
means dull; drinking, dancing, and parties formed a constant round of
entertainment in which the visitors gladly take part. Hay and John Kinzie
(later the founder of Chicago) played the flute and fiddle for parties
and dances, as well as for the ladies alone, and at Mass in the home of
one of the oldest residents, Barthelemy. Their religion was an intricate
part of the lives of the French inhabitants. During the four months Hay
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
was at Miamitown, Mass was celebrated at Barthelemy&rsquo;s house by
Father Louis Payet, a missionary from Detroit. After playing at Mass on
one occasion, Hay wrote, &ldquo;The French settlers of this place go to
prayers of a Sunday, morning and evening, ... the people are collected
by the Ringing of three cow bells, which three boys runs about thro&rsquo; the
village, which makes as much noise as twenty cows would.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_97" href="#fn_1_97">[97]</a></p>
<p>Miamitown in 1790 had certain refinements not to be expected behind
its rough exterior. Afternoon coffee and lunch was served in the
home of Mrs. Adhemar on numerous occasions. Dinners were given in
grand style. For the parties the men and women dressed in their finest
apparel. Mr. Adhemar and Mr. DeSeleron made their appearance at a
ball wearing very fine fur caps, &ldquo;adorned with a quantity of Black Ostridge
Feathers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cockades made with white tinsell Ribbon, amasingly
large.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_98" href="#fn_1_98">[98]</a> Less refining was the constant drinking. At different
times, Hay and his companions became &ldquo;infernally drunk&rdquo;, &ldquo;very
drunk&rdquo;, and &ldquo;damned drunk&rdquo;. One affair was memorable in that none
of the men became drunk, &ldquo;which is mostly the case in this place when
they collect together&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_99" href="#fn_1_99">[99]</a> Dancing was also a favorite pastime, so much
so, that after dancing three nights in succession, Hay found his feet too
swollen to continue. It appeared as if dancing was never enjoyed more
by anyone than by these French &ldquo;habitants&rdquo;. It became almost a passion;
when they grew weary of the old steps, new ones were devised.
The almost annual springtime flood seems to have been more severe
than usual in the year 1790. But not even the flood dampened the gaiety,
for before the waters had subsided, the ladies were taken for a row
on the river to be serenaded by the flute and fiddle. Not all was fun and
frolic, however, as business was transacted regularly by the traders.</p>
<p>In strange contrast to the minuet and &ldquo;dance ronby&rdquo; were the wild
war dances of the Indians across the river in celebration of a victorious
raid on the American settlements.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_100" href="#fn_1_100">[100]</a> From the French village situated on
the St. Joseph river where it meets the St. Mary&rsquo;s, Hay could easily see
these spectacles. Behind the traders&rsquo; houses, northward to Spy Run
Creek, lived the band of Miamis under LeGris, one of the most prominent
and intellectual chiefs of his time. Across the river, in the present
Lakeside area of Fort Wayne, was the principal village of the Miamis
under Pacan, who in his youth had saved Captain Morris.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_101" href="#fn_1_101">[101]</a> Frequent
discussions were held by the traders with Pacan, LeGris, Blue Jacket,
and Little Turtle; LeGris and Little Turtle often ate and stayed at Hay&rsquo;s
house. The three Girty brothers, the terrors of the frontier, visited
Miamitown on a number of occasions during Hay&rsquo;s sojourn. James and
George Girty lived only three miles from Miamitown, and came more
often than their brother, Simon. It is noteworthy that Hay obligingly
wrote a letter for George Girty to Alexander McKee, the British Indian
agent, informing McKee that the Miamis had upbraided the Delawares
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
by &ldquo;telling them that the Ground they occupied now is not theirs and
that ... the Delawares answered, they were great fools to fight for lands
that was not theirs and consequently would not go to war against the
Americans any more.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_102" href="#fn_1_102">[102]</a> Girty asked McKee to check the Delaware
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>It is clear that the inhabitants of Miamitown were, for the most
part, English partisans. Hay could not venture his &ldquo;carcass&rdquo; among the
&ldquo;parcel of renegards&rdquo; [sic] at Vincennes.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_103" href="#fn_1_103">[103]</a> When Antoine Lasselle did
venture southward and was captured by the Indians who thought him to
be sympathetic with the Americans, Major Murray intervened and the
people of the village certified that Lasselle was &ldquo;a good loyalist&rdquo; and
&ldquo;always for supporting his King&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_104" href="#fn_1_104">[104]</a> When Lorraine, an inhabitant of
Miamitown for forty years, died and was buried, &ldquo;the young Volunteers
of the place gave him three Vollies ... in Honor to his services rendered
to the King of Great Britain.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_105" href="#fn_1_105">[105]</a> Evidently the time Lorraine had aided
Pontiac&rsquo;s Indians in capturing the British post at Ouiatenon was forgotten
at this late date. Not all of the traders at Miamitown were good
loyalists, however. James Abbott is described as being &ldquo;one of our
dis-affected subjects.&rdquo; He refused to obtain the necessary permit for
trading and spoke to the Indians of &ldquo;Major Murray &amp; Capt. McKee in
so disrespectfull a manner that they ... determined to send Strings of
Wampum into Detroit immediately to informe them of it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_106" href="#fn_1_106">[106]</a></p>
<p>On the first of April, 1790, Hay departed for Detroit, &ldquo;much regretted
by every one in the village&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_107" href="#fn_1_107">[107]</a> Less than seven months later
Miamitown lay in ashes, ravaged by an American army which left 183
of its men dead in the vicinity. There is nothing in Hay&rsquo;s journal to indicate
that the French, English, or Indian occupants of the villages anticipated
the blow which was to be dealt them by Harmar&rsquo;s army, although
they were fully aware of the movements which preceded the
coming of Harmar. &ldquo;John Thompson [a
prisoner] ... informed me their
was great talk of raising men to come against the Ind&rsquo;s&rdquo;, wrote Hay on
March 24, 1790. &ldquo;However&rdquo;, he continued, &ldquo;General St. Clair who is
now at the Big Miami [Cincinnati] with two boat loads of goods, means
to call the Indians together at a Council at Post Vincennes&mdash;But if the
Indians do not come to a settlement with them, they mean to fight
them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_1_107">[107]</a></p>
<p>This and other councils were held. St. Clair, governor of the newly
created Northwest Territory, following Washington&rsquo;s instructions, offered
peace to the Indians. Antoine Gamelin, a merchant from Vincennes
favorably known by the Indians, was sent with the Governor&rsquo;s overtures
to the hostile Indians. The tribes along the Wabash would give
Gamelin no answer until he conferred with those at Miamitown. Here,
the Indians, as well as the traders, assembled to hear Gamelin&rsquo;s speech.
Their reply was evasive and unsatisfactory, while their true attitude was
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
revealed by the burning of an American prisoner only three days after
Gamelin&rsquo;s departure.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_108" href="#fn_1_108">[108]</a></p>
<p>War was now inevitable, and during the five years of bloody conflict
that followed, Miamitown was the principal goal of the American
forces. As early as 1784, Washington had confided in his future Secretary
of War, Henry Knox, that the establishment of a strong post at
Miamitown was desirable for the welfare of the new nation in the
West.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_109" href="#fn_1_109">[109]</a> The following year, Washington wrote to Richard Henry Lee
for the benefit of the Continental Congress, advocating a strong western
policy. In his letter Washington said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it not be worthy of the wisdom and the attention of congress
to have the western waters well explored, the navigation of them
fully ascertained, and accurately laid down, ... at least as far westerly
as the Miamis running into the Ohio [the Great Miami] and
Lake Erie [the Maumee] ... for I cannot forbear observing that the
Miami village points to an important post for the Union.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_110" href="#fn_1_110">[110]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Clair, while in Philadelphia during 1790, talked to both Secretary
of War, Henry Knox and President Washington, and suggested that an
American fort be established on the site of Miamitown.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_111" href="#fn_1_111">[111]</a> Writing to
Knox on November 26, 1790, St. Clair again urged that General Harmar
in the forthcoming campaign be empowered to carry out this plan,
concluding his argument by saying, &ldquo;we [will] never have peace with
the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_112" href="#fn_1_112">[112]</a> Knox, after
conferring with Washington, rejected the idea. In doing so, he wrote to
the disappointed St. Clair, the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contemplating the establishment of military posts northwest of the
Ohio, to answer the purposes of awing the Indians residing on the
Wabash, the west end of Lake Erie, St. Joseph&rsquo;s, and the Illinois ...
and, at the same time, exhibiting a respectable appearance to the
British troops at Detroit and Niagara, the Miami village presents itself
as superior to any other position. This opinion was given to me by
the President in the year 1784, and has several times been held forth
by me to Brigadier Harmar. But at the same time, it must be acknowledged
that the measure would involve a much larger military establishment
than perhaps the value of the object or disposition of the United
States would admit, and that it would be so opposed to the inclinations
of the Indians generally ... as to bring on inevitably an Indian
war of some duration. In addition to which, it is supposed that
the British garrison would find themselves so uneasy with such a
force impending over them as not only to occasion a considerable
reinforcement of their upper posts, but also fomenting ... the opposition
of the Indians.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_113" href="#fn_1_113">[113]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the government did not wish to offend Great
Britain, a policy which was not too strong perhaps, but one that kept the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
young republic at peace at a crucial time in her history. The proposed
attack on Miamitown had to be under the guise of punishing the Indians.
To do this and retire was permissible, but the establishment of an
American fort there would have been considered by the British as a
dagger pointed at Detroit. Consequently, when Harmar finally moved
from Fort Washington with his army of 1,600 men, he had orders to destroy
Miamitown and, if possible, its Indian occupants. Harmar himself
promised that, in the event of a successful campaign, he would attend to
&ldquo;the villanous traders&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_114" href="#fn_1_114">[114]</a> Interestingly the British officials at Detroit
and Canada believed that Harmar fully intended to build a fort at
Miamitown although they expressed surprise at the &ldquo;imprudence&rdquo; of
such action. Their spies, such as the Girties and Alexander McKee, kept
them well informed of the strength and movement of Harmar&rsquo;s army.
They even noted Harmar&rsquo;s tendency to be intoxicated.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_115" href="#fn_1_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>Forewarned by the British agents of the impending attack, the Indians
adopted a &ldquo;scorched earth&rdquo; policy. The traders were forced to
give their stores of ammunition to the Indians and were aided in fleeing
with what goods they could carry. What was not destroyed by the Indians
at Miamitown was burned by the Americans (20,000 bushels of
corn, among other things). In two major engagements, the first at Hellar&rsquo;s
Corners, eight miles north of Miamitown, and the second, a
three-pronged attack within the heart of the village and on the banks of
the Maumee and St. Joseph rivers, the Indian forces, under Little Turtle,
were victorious.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_116" href="#fn_1_116">[116]</a> Although their crops and towns were destroyed and
the trade ruined, the Indians were elated over their victories, and their
frontier raids continued.</p>
<p>Knox now felt that, despite possible British disapproval, the only
means of checking the Indians was to establish the fort at Miamitown
for which St. Clair had asked. To carry this out, the Secretary of War
asked Congress to increase the size of the army. The force contemplated
for the intended post was 1,000 to 1,200 men. St. Clair argued that a
strong fort at Miamitown &ldquo;would curb the Wabash Indians, as well as
the Ottawas and Chippewas, and all other northern tribes&rdquo;; that it would
&ldquo;more effectually cover the line of frontier along the Ohio, than by a
post any other place whatever (excluding Detroit)&rdquo;; and &ldquo;would afford
more fully security to the territory of the United States northwest of the
Ohio.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_117" href="#fn_1_117">[117]</a> For an economy-minded Congress, he pointed out that &ldquo;it
would assist in the reduction of the national debt, by holding out security
to people to purchase and settle the public lands.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_118" href="#fn_1_118">[118]</a></p>
<p>General Knox still feared English hostility to this move, and he instructed
St. Clair to &ldquo;make such intimations as may remove all such
disposition.&rdquo; These intimations, however, were better to follow, than
precede, the possession of the post, unless circumstances dictated
otherwise, as it was &ldquo;not the inclination of the United States to enter
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
into a contest with Great Britain.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_119" href="#fn_1_119">[119]</a></p>
<p>St. Clair never reached Miamitown. Badly trained and inexperienced,
his army of 1,400 men suffered one of the most terrible defeats
ever inflicted on American forces. Five hundred and thirty-two men fell
before Little Turtle&rsquo;s Indians on the site of Fort Recovery, Ohio. The
situation was now critical. The Indians now attacked the frontier with
impunity and another defeat might mean the complete alienation of the
West from the new union. At this crucial point, General Anthony
Wayne, hero of Stony Point in the Revolution, was appointed
commander-in-chief of the American army. It is not necessary to give in
detail the long months of preparation of Wayne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; and the
swift campaign which was carried out in the Maumee valley. Wayne cut
the Indian forces in two by feinting toward Miamitown, then moving between
it and the English Fort Miami at the mouth of the Maumee. Before
the various tribes could reorganize fully, the &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; turned on
the Indian forces to the east. At Fallen Timbers, a short distance from
Toledo, on August 20, 1794, Wayne&rsquo;s army met and defeated the red
men. The Indian power in the Northwest was for the time being shattered
and Wayne moved down the Maumee to complete his task, the
construction, near the site of the old Kiskakon, of a new American
stronghold in the Northwest&mdash;Fort Wayne.</p>

<br />The Establishment of Fort Wayne&mdash;Government Outpost of Defense, Diplomacy and Trade</h2>
<p>Wayne&rsquo;s victorious &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; arrived at Miamitown on the evening
of September 17, 1794. Lieutenant John Boyer, to whose journal we are
indebted for the best account of the conditions relating to the construction
of Fort Wayne, wrote on the day of the arrival:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... there are nearly five hundred acres of cleared land lying in one
body on the rivers St. Joseph, St. Mary&rsquo;s and Miami; there are fine
points of land contiguous to those rivers adjoining the cleared land
... the land adjacent [is] fertile and well timbered, and from every
appearance it has been one of the largest settlements made by the Indians
in this country.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_1" href="#fn_2_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the following day, Wayne reconnoitered the ground and selected the
site for the new fort, an elevated position on the right bank of the
Maumee just below the confluence of the St. Mary&rsquo;s and St. Joseph rivers.
The ground chosen approximates lots 11, 12, and 13 of the present
Taber addition on the northeast corner of East Berry and Clay street.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_2" href="#fn_2_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Wayne determined to build a strong fortification, much to the disapproval
of Lieutenant William Clark, who felt that a common picketed
one would be equally as difficult for the savages.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_3" href="#fn_2_3">[3]</a> It is conceivable that
Wayne in building a strong fortification feared a future British attack
equally as much as he feared the Indians. Actual construction began on
September 24. The difficulties were many. The season was late, and the
fort had to be completed before winter came. The regulars had been
good fighters, but proved to be poor workers. All the severity of the
army code was required to keep them in line, one hundred lashes on
their bare backs being the usual punishment. The volunteers were rebellious;
for a while they were employed convoying the supplies from Fort
Defiance to Fort Wayne over the improved road Wayne had constructed,
but finally, when Wayne could no longer cope with the Kentucky
militiamen, they were sent home. Provisions were also scarce and prices
were high. Not infrequently the men were on half-rations, while the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
horses died at the rate of five a day for lack of feed. A ten gallon keg
of whiskey cost eight dollars; a pint of salt, when it could be obtained,
brought six dollars.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_4" href="#fn_2_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, Wayne seemed well-satisfied with the
construction of his new fort, which was capable of resisting 24 pound
guns. By October 17, he felt &ldquo;free to pronounce them [Fort Wayne and
Fort Defiance] the most respectable now in the occupancy of the United
States, even in their present situation which is not quite perfect as
yet.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_5" href="#fn_2_5">[5]</a> Construction was pushed with all possible speed, and although
the fort was not quite completed, the day of dedication was set for October
22, 1794, the fourth anniversary of Harmar&rsquo;s defeat. Early that
morning, after firing fifteen rounds of cannon in honor of the fifteen
states in the Union, the flag was raised. Colonel Hamtramck then named
the new fortification, &ldquo;Fort Wayne.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_6" href="#fn_2_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; departed for Greenville on October 28, leaving
Lieutenant-Colonel John Francis Hamtramck in command of four infantry
companies and one artillery battery at Fort Wayne. Colonel Hamtramck
is described as being &ldquo;a small Canadian Frenchman, an intelligent,
capable, and meritorious officer.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_7" href="#fn_2_7">[7]</a> After serving in the Revolution,
Hamtramck came to the West with Harmar, being in command at
Vincennes when he joined Wayne&rsquo;s army. Although somewhat of a martinet,
Hamtramck was popular with his men and, from all accounts, one
of the most efficient officers in the army at that time.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that Wayne left a capable man in charge of Fort
Wayne, as Hamtramck&rsquo;s difficulties proved to be many. There still remained
a great deal of work to be done in strengthening the fort, which
was not completed until the following spring. The garrison was plagued
by an epidemic of malaria fever during the first summer. This condition
was made worse by the lack of quinine or any medical supplies.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_8" href="#fn_2_8">[8]</a> During
the winter, the men often went about in rags and tatters. Hamtramck
was forced to permit them to cut up their blankets and turn them into
over-coats.</p>
<p>Facing such difficulties, it is little wonder that Hamtramck complained
frequently to Generals Wayne and Wilkinson about the problems
of disciplining his rebellious men and caring for the destitute Indians
who were returning to their ruined villages. Concerning the soldiers
Hamtramck wrote, &ldquo;I have flogged them until I am tired. The economic
allowance of one hundred lashes, allowed by the government, does not
appear a sufficient inducement for a rascal to act the part of an honest
man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_9" href="#fn_2_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Hamtramck was actively engaged at this time in discussions with
the chiefs, particularly Little Turtle, LeGris, and Richardville, concerning
the proposed peace negotiations to be held at Greenville the following
summer. In these matters, Hamtramck was aided immensely by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Lasselle brothers, Antoine and Jacques.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_10" href="#fn_2_10">[10]</a> Antoine had resided at
Miamitown from 1771 until Harmer&rsquo;s destruction of the village in 1790.
He had fought on the side of the Indians in the battle of Fallen Timbers
and had been captured by Wayne&rsquo;s troops. Tried as a spy, he narrowly
escaped the gallows through Hamtramck&rsquo;s intercession. Colonel John
Johnston, Indian factor at Fort Wayne, later described Antoine Lasselle
as a man of wit and drollery who &ldquo;would often clasp his neck with both
hands to show how near he had been to hanging by order of Mad Anthony.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_11" href="#fn_2_11">[11]</a>
After his release, Antoine Lasselle with his brother Jacques
returned to Fort Wayne, apparently the first traders to do so. Here they
furnished the Americans with supplies and used their strong influence
with the Miamis to the good advantage of the American cause.</p>
<p>The Indians had asked that the forthcoming peace conference be
held at their old village, Kekionga, as Kiskakon had come to be called
by that time. Wayne insisted that the tribesmen come to Greenville, 79
miles southeast of Fort Wayne. Resorting to the use of Indian symbolism,
Wayne argued, &ldquo;It was there [Kekionga] that the hatchet was
first raised, to bury a bloody hatchet there would disturb the spirits of
the unburied dead.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_12" href="#fn_2_12">[12]</a> Wayne&rsquo;s real reasons were less symbolic, but
more practical. The distance of bringing supplies to Fort Wayne would
be much farther than to Greenville, and at Greenville he would have his
&ldquo;Legion&rdquo; ready in case of trouble. In the spring the Indians going to
Greenville came by way of Fort Wayne, so overcrowding the post that
Hamtramck&rsquo;s garrison had to go on half-rations to feed the delegates.
Even this did not suffice; emergency stores were depleted, while the
liquor and tobacco were so exhausted that Hamtramck had to buy additional
supplies from Antoine Lasselle.</p>
<p>At Greenville Wayne won the peace which Fallen Timbers had secured.
In respect to Fort Wayne, which remained an American island
deep in Indian Territory, the United States gained an area of six square
miles around the fort, free use of the Maumee-Wabash portage, and an
area of two square miles at the Wabash end of the portage. The Indians
also promised the United States the use of the roads leading to Fort
Wayne from Defiance to the northeast and Piqua to the southeast. Little
Turtle, Wayne&rsquo;s keenest antagonist during the negotiations, debated long
and eloquently over these concessions at and around Fort Wayne. The
great Miami chief secured one compromise from the General, a reduction
of the land around the fort to be ceded to the United States. After
this concession by Wayne, Little Turtle addressed the council:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These people [the French] were seen by our forefathers first at Detroit;
afterwards we saw them at the Miami village&mdash;that glorious gate
which your younger brothers had the happiness to own.... Brothers,
these people never told us they wished to purchase these lands from
us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>I now give you the true sentiments of your younger brothers
with respect to the reservation at the Miami villages. We thank you
kindly for contracting the limits you at first proposed. We wish you
to take this six mile square on the side of the river where your fort
now stands, as your younger brothers wish to inhabit that beloved
spot again ... The next place you pointed to was the Little River, and
said you wanted two miles square at that place. This is a request that
our fathers, the French or British, never made us; it was always ours.
This carrying place has heretofore proved in a great degree, the subsistence
of your younger brothers. That place has brought us in the
course of one day, the amount of one hundred dollars. Let us both
own this place.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_13" href="#fn_2_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this Wayne replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Little Turtle observes, he never heard of any cession made at that
place [Fort Wayne] to the French. I have traced the lines of two forts
at that point ... and it is ever an established rule, among the Europeans,
to reserve as much ground around their forts, as their cannon
can command.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_14" href="#fn_2_14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wayne could not grant Little Turtle&rsquo;s request for joint-control of
the Maumee-Wabash portage since the Northwest Ordinance of 1787
guaranteed to everyone free use of all important portages (Article V).
Wayne proved himself an economist and shrewd diplomat by arguing
before the other assembled tribes that the tolls garnered by the Miamis
actually were passed off to all the Indians in the form of higher prices
for the traders goods. At length, Little Turtle, speaking for four tribes
besides the Miamis, expressed himself as satisfied with the treaty, and
being the last to sign it, promised he would be the last to break it.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_15" href="#fn_2_15">[15]</a>
This he never did, as he spent the last seventeen years of his life at
peace with the Americans.</p>
<p>In a farewell address to the conference, Little Turtle asked that the
United States government appoint Captain William Wells as resident interpreter
at Fort Wayne. William Wells, frontier scout and pioneer, was
one of the most romantic and mysterious figures in the early history of
the Northwest. A biography or even a sketch of his life has never been
written, although his story is intimately connected with that of Fort
Wayne and the Indiana Territory. Between 1794 and 1812, when
he was killed, Captain Wells was decidedly the most interesting white
person in the history of Fort Wayne. Little is known about him personally,
except that which we can obtain from letters written by him or
those concerning him. A member of prominent Kentucky family and the
brother of Colonel Samuel Wells of Louisville, William Wells had been
kidnapped by a band of Miamis when he was twelve year old. Taken to
Miamitown, he was adopted by the tribe of Little Turtle and was raised
by the Indians, as was the custom of that time. It is not surprising, consequently,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
that the Frenchman, Count Volney described Wells as &ldquo;tall
and muscular, quick in movement, and having the complexion of an Indian.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_16" href="#fn_2_16">[16]</a>
It is surprising, however, that Wells, having little or no education,
in later life showed in his letters a knowledge of the English language
and clarity of thought far superior to his white associates on the
frontier.</p>
<p>Wells&rsquo; first wife was Anahquah, Little Turtle&rsquo;s sister; and upon her
death, it is believed that Wells married Wahmangopath, the daughter of
the chief. By these marriages, Wells had the following children: Anne,
who was educated at the Catholic school at Bardstown, Kentucky, and
who later returned to Fort Wayne to marry Dr. William Turner; Mary,
who married James Wolcott; Rebecca, who married James Hackley at
Fort Wayne; Jane Turner, who married John H. Griggs, and William
Wayne, who after graduating from West Point, died at an early age. On
March 7, 1809, Wells married Mary Geiger, daughter of Colonel Frederick
Geiger of Kentucky, by whom he had three children, Samuel
Geiger, Yelberton, and Julia Ann.</p>
<p>Against Harmar&rsquo;s and St. Clair&rsquo;s armies, Wells fought willingly on
the side of the Indians. In 1794, however, he joined Wayne&rsquo;s forces apparently
with Little Turtle&rsquo;s approval. It is known that in the summer of
1793, Wells paid a visit to his white relatives in Kentucky. Upon returning
through Vincennes, he met Col. Hamtramck, who employed him to
carry a message to Wayne.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_17" href="#fn_2_17">[17]</a> In the message, Hamtramck suggested to
Wayne that Wells would prove invaluable as a scout, if the General saw
fit to give him a commission. Before accepting this offer, Wells returned
to Miamitown, and here secured Little Turtle&rsquo;s consent. The
reason for Wells&rsquo; desertion of the Indian cause has never been clear.
Perhaps Hamtramck, later one of Wells&rsquo; staunchest friends, convinced
him that the American cause was to be successful. Possibly, as Quaife
suggests, it was due to a belated consciousness of his true race identity
and the pleadings of his white relatives while he was in Kentucky.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_18" href="#fn_2_18">[18]</a>
The fact that Wells and Little Turtle remained intimate afterward and
that their viewpoints were always identical, indicates there was no friction
between them. It is known that Little Turtle did not wish to give
battle to Wayne at Fallen Timbers, and advised the Indians to make
peace. While only conjecture, it is not unreasonable to assume that
Wells foresaw the American success in the forthcoming campaign and
convinced the chief it was to the red man&rsquo;s advantage to make peace.</p>
<p>Wells was placed in command of Wayne&rsquo;s scouts, and it was primarily
through his vigilance that Wayne&rsquo;s forces were not surprised. At
Greenville, Wells served as an interpreter, a position of trust. Wayne
was willing to grant Little Turtle&rsquo;s request to appoint Wells as resident
interpreter at Fort Wayne, and later wrote to the government recommending
Wells for the position, as well as authorizing the payment of
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
high rewards to this valuable scout.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_19" href="#fn_2_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>During the winter of 1795-96, Hamtramck found the food and supply
situation at Fort Wayne somewhat better, although there were about
90 children and old women entirely dependent on the garrison for their
subsistence. Until the British post at Detroit was transferred to the United
States, Fort Wayne was the headquarters for detachments at the following
western forts: Defiance, Sandusky, Adams, Recovery, Jefferson,
Loramie, Head of the Auglaise, and Michilimackinac. In June, 1796,
Col. Hamtramck was ordered to proceed to Detroit and take command
of the former British post there. After his departure, the force at Fort
Wayne never numbered more than 100 men. These men held an important
position along the first line of defense in the northwest. Other than
Michilimackinac, there were no posts to the north or northwest until Ft.
Dearborn was erected in 1803. The men at Fort Wayne acted as if they
had little realization of their responsibility. The majority of the enlisted
men of that day were drawn from the most turbulent elements of the
east. The soldier&rsquo;s life was not a popular vocation. At this western outpost,
garrison life was more than harsh; it was extremely boring. The
troops at Fort Wayne had nothing to do in their leisure time, and usually
passed their days in drinking, fighting, and gambling.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_20" href="#fn_2_20">[20]</a> In vain did the
officers have insubordinate men flogged at parade (not infrequently the
maximum penalty of 100 lashes was given), deprived them of their
whiskey rations, and put them to hard labor. When, in 1812, Congress
amended the articles of war to prohibit flogging, other substitute
punishments, hardly less severe and equally degrading, were devised.
Men were confined in small dark rooms, put astride spiked wooden
horses, forced to wear the wooden collar, ankle bolts, and irons. In the
Orderly Books for the Fort Wayne garrison, we repeatedly find non-commissioned
officers demoted to the ranks for misconduct or crimes of
one nature or another, only to be reinstated when their successors
proved even more incapable. Yet, when this wild, bored garrison was
besieged during the War of 1812, they successfully held the fort against
a force six times as strong.</p>
<p>Living within the fort were the wives and children of those married
officers and men who chose to bring their families to the wilderness
with them. In many respects these women shared the army life of their
husbands. They were governed by the same military regulations, even
receiving the same daily whiskey ration as did the men. The officers
and their families generally came from an older and more formal society
and carried into the rude barracks the manners and customs of the East.
One of the commanders, Col. Hunt, brought his family directly to Fort
Wayne from their Boston home. With this eastern culture was added a
certain punctilio, a natural consequence of military life. The officers&rsquo;
families, together with those of government officials and more prominent
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
settlers, formed the elite of the American society at Fort Wayne. In
1807 Lieutenant Philip Ostrander, an officer at Fort Wayne, wrote to his
friend, George Hoffman, collector for the government at Michilimackinac:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On my arrival at this post I was received with the utmost politeness
by Captain Heald [the commandant] who continues to show me every
flattering attention. Indeed, sir, by every officer ... at this place I
have been treated with the utmost liberality and respect. The very day
of my arrival, I was requested to dine with Captain Wells [the Indian
agent] and today by Mr. Johnson, our present factor at this post.
[Col. John Johnston, superintendent of the government &ldquo;factory&rdquo;] I
do not mention these circumstances through vanity, but merely with
intention of informing you that everyone endeavors to make my place
of residence comfortable and happy.</p>
<p>I could form no conception of what an agreeable situation this
is, both as to the face of the country and the elegant situation of the
fort. We are, however, destitute of one thing which would make the
situation still more agreeable&mdash;that is, society. Mr. Johnson
[Johnston], Captain Wells, J. Audrian [a
trader], and the officers of
the garrison compose our party. They tell me that the place is in general
healthy, but, to tell the truth, I have seen a number of very sick
people. Dr. Edwards had unfortunately started for Cincinnati an hour
before my arrival.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_21" href="#fn_2_21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Edwards, who had recently been given authority to serve as a
merchant at the fort in addition to his duties as post surgeon, evidently
had gone to Cincinnati to obtain supplies. Judging from the above letter
and other sources, it must be concluded that the number of sick at Fort
Wayne was generally quite high. Before Dr. Edwards came there were
twenty-five men reported on the sick list, almost 35% of the garrison.
This may have been somewhat of an abnormal condition, however, as his
predecessor, a man named Dr. Elliot, was so incompetent, that Mr.
Johnston, the government factor, had to act as post surgeon.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_22" href="#fn_2_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Colonel Hamtramck remained in command of Fort Wayne until
June, 1796. In March of that year he had been ordered to move down
the Maumee with a detachment from Fort Wayne in order to counteract
a demonstration by the British which was possibly intended to arouse
the Indians to revolt. While encamped on the Maumee, Hamtramck received
a message from General Wilkinson, directing him to receive the
transfer of the British Post Miami and then proceed to Detroit to take
command of the former British post, Fort Lernoult.</p>
<p>Colonel David Strong, Hamtramck&rsquo;s successor at Fort Wayne, had,
like Hamtramck, served in the Revolution and in Wayne&rsquo;s army. Prior
to coming to Fort Wayne he had been in command at Fort Greenville.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_23" href="#fn_2_23">[23]</a>
The twenty-six months of Colonel Strong&rsquo;s administration witnessed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
beginnings of the new Frenchtown at Fort Wayne. Located across the
St. Joseph from the site of the old Frenchtown, this new village was
situated where Kekionga or Kiskakon once stood in the present Lakeside
area of Fort Wayne. Most of the inhabitants were either former occupants
of Miamitown who returned to this new site after Wayne&rsquo;s victory
or French-Canadians of the Detroit-River Raisin region. Volney, a native
of France who traveled in the United States during 1796, questioned
the Americans concerning these French &ldquo;habitants&rdquo; of the northwest.
He was told that they were a kind, hospitable, and sociable sort of
people, &ldquo;but in ignorance and idleness they beat the Indians. They
know nothing of civil and domestic affairs; their women neither sew or
spin or make butter but pass their time in gossiping and tattle. The men
hunt, fish, roam in the woods, and bask in the sun.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_24" href="#fn_2_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>In weighing the value of this characterization of the French &ldquo;habitants,&rdquo;
we must remember that Volney an intellectual coming from the
Paris of the Enlightenment naturally thought of these people as crude
and rustic, as indeed they must have appeared to him, but what is more
important neither Volney or the Americans appreciated that these French
Creoles way of life was different from theirs. The Creoles were not as
interested in the middle-class virtue of respectability nor in the acquisition
of much property.</p>
<p>Evidently the English-American opinion of the French people living
in the Northwest had not changed since the days of George Croghan and
earlier. Nor in all likelihood had the French &ldquo;habitants&rdquo; and traders
changed their manner of living to any great extent. Although they had
suffered a great deal financially and were less prosperous since the
American occupation of the territory, there is no reason to doubt that
these people lived as they did during Henry Hay&rsquo;s sojourn at
Miamitown, independent and satisfied with life.</p>
<p>There is no way of determining the number of inhabitants living in
Frenchtown at this time. That the settlement was at least worthy of
notice is indicative from the Orderly Books for Fort Wayne. Mention is
made repeatedly of the town.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_25" href="#fn_2_25">[25]</a> The soldiers and their wives were in the
habit of frequenting the town, which practice some officers considered
inimical to the garrison&rsquo;s welfare. All military orders published for the
civilians living around Fort Wayne were made out in French as well as
English, and until the early 1820&rsquo;s the majority of the population of Fort
Wayne were either French or of French-Indian blood.</p>
<p>While most of these French inhabitants during these years remain
unknown, there are a few individuals whom we can identify. Besides
Antoine Lasselle, there was another member of the Lasselle family who
returned to Fort Wayne at an early date. This was Hyacinth Lasselle, the
nephew of Antoine Lasselle and the son of Jacques Lasselle. Hyacinth
Lasselle was only four years old when his family fled from Miamitown
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
at the advance of LaBalme&rsquo;s force in 1780. After this he was placed in
a private school in Montreal. In May, 1795, he returned to Fort Wayne
from where he carried on trading activities until 1804 when he removed
his establishment to Vincennes. In appearance he was rather short, being
about five feet six inches tall, but at the same time very muscular. His
athletic prowess and the fact that he was born at Miamitown made him
a great favorite of the Miamis, who entered him in contests against the
champions of other tribes.</p>
<p>Other inhabitants of the former Miamitown who returned to the site
of Fort Wayne after the American Occupation were Antoine Rivard or
Rivarrd and Francis Minie. Rivard&rsquo;s wife and daughter had entertained
Henry Hay quite often while the latter stayed at Miamitown. Included
among the new arrivals at Frenchtown were Charles and James Peltier,
brothers who had come here from Detroit around 1798. In 1804 the
Peltiers secured permission to sell supplies to the garrison at Fort
Wayne. At a later date, Charles Peltier was attacked and eaten by
wolves within a few miles of the fort. James Peltier married Angeline
Chapeteau, an attractive young girl who had come to Fort Wayne from
Detroit with her grandparents, Jean Baptiste Maloch and his wife. Jean
Baptiste Maloch had been a resident at Detroit before the time of Pontiac&rsquo;s
conspiracy, and he was apparently considered to be a man of
some wealth.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_26" href="#fn_2_26">[26]</a> What prompted him to bring his wife and granddaughter
to Fort Wayne at this late date in his life is unknown. Angeline
Chapeteau, who was only sixteen when she came to Fort Wayne, instantly
became a favorite of the Miamis, who called her &ldquo;Golden Hair&rdquo;
and formally adopted her into their tribe. Her sister Theresa Chapeteau
married Francis Minie, while a second sister married Charles Peltier.
One of the most prosperous traders at Fort Wayne prior to the war of
1812 was Louis Bourie. Not only did he trade in furs himself, but he
also kept pack horses and large warehouse for the transportation and
storage of the merchandise and furs carried by way of the Maumee-Wabash
portage. For these services he collected a handsome profit. Two
other traders who married Miami women were Peter LaFontaine and Antoine
Bondie.</p>
<p>To the west of the fort there came into being a collection of government
buildings and sutlers&rsquo; establishments, which in time resembled
a small village. These log buildings were located at the meeting place of
two roads, &ldquo;Wayne&rsquo;s trace&rdquo; (this was the road connecting Fort Wayne
with Fort Washington, Cincinnati) and the old Maumee-Wabash portage
path.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_27" href="#fn_2_27">[27]</a> This was the nucleus of the village that made up the plat of the
original town of Fort Wayne, when it was laid out in 1824. The sutlers,
who lived here, were traders who had been given permission by the
government to occupy choice locations near a military outpost and carry
on the trade deemed necessary for the garrison. These sutlers were subject
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
to the orders of the commander of the fort, who could dismiss them
upon a just provocation. It was also the commander&rsquo;s duty to see to it
that the men were not overcharged and investigate any complaints
brought to him either by the sutlers or soldiers. For instance the soldiers
complained on one occasion that James Peltier was overcharging them
for his merchandise. After an investigation, the commander, Captain
Whipple, excused Peltier on the grounds that the cost of transportation
for the winter had risen to one hundred dollars a boatload.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_28" href="#fn_2_28">[28]</a> The sutlers
brought their merchandise either by way of the Maumee from Detroit
and the East or by way of the St. Mary&rsquo;s from Cincinnati and the Ohio
River.</p>
<p>The largest of the log buildings comprising the small village west
of the fort was the two-story council house. This was erected in 1804 by
the government to be used as a meeting place between the government
officials and the Indians. Around the village and along the banks across
the river were gardens and cultivated fields of vegetables and corn. One
of the better farms was owned by Colonel Hamtramck and William
Wells. Wells managed it and by 1800 had it well fenced. On the property
were several buildings, a good orchard, a number of livestock, plus
the usual corn fields. Several negro slaves whom Wells had brought
from Kentucky did most of the labor.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_29" href="#fn_2_29">[29]</a> Apparently this farm did not
always furnish a dependable source of income, for in 1801, Wells reported
to Hamtramck that although he expected to harvest 350 bushels
of corn for each of them, he would not be able to sell it because of the
overabundance of corn raised that year around Fort Wayne.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_30" href="#fn_2_30">[30]</a> The reason
for this, Wells maintained, was the fact that the military were competing
in the corn market. The officers of Fort Wayne were in the practice of
having the enlisted men farm the fields for wages.</p>
<p>In June, 1797, the newly appointed General of the United States
Army, James Wilkinson, stopped at Fort Wayne during his initial tour of
inspection of the western forts. Here he found conditions &ldquo;truly deplorable&rdquo;.
In his report he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The army in this quarter presents a frightful picture of the scientific
soldier; ignorance and licentiousness have been fostered, while intelligence
and virtue have been persecuted and exiled; the consequences
were that factions have been generated to sanction enormity, and it
follows that all ideas of system, economy, order, subordination and
discipline were banished, and that disorder, vice, absurdity, and
abuse infected every member of the corps militarie.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_31" href="#fn_2_31">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilkinson was equally dissatisfied with conditions at Detroit. In fact he
found fault everywhere, for the General had a habit of exaggerating ills
so that he might gain more credit for employing successful antidotes. He
never doubted that his methods were correct, and his solution for the
problems at Fort Wayne and Detroit was relatively simple. He merely
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
exchanged garrisons and commandants between the two posts. Colonel
Hamtramck with the First Regiment was transferred to Fort Wayne, and
Colonel David Strong at Fort Wayne with the Second Regiment was
transferred to Detroit.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_32" href="#fn_2_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Whether or not General Wilkinson achieved his purpose of bettering
conditions at Fort Wayne and Detroit by these transfers is not
known. At any rate Colonel Hamtramck did not remain long at Fort
Wayne. In less than a year he was ordered back to Detroit and there he
remained in command until his death in 1803. In April, 1798, a month
before his final departure from Fort Wayne, his son, John Francis, was
born. As far as it is known, this child was the first white person born
within the stockade.</p>
<p>On May 16, 1798, Colonel Thomas Hunt arrived at Fort Wayne to
take command. Colonel Hunt had served with distinction in the Revolution.
Born in Massachusetts, he became a member of Captain&rsquo;s Croft&rsquo;s
Company of &ldquo;minute men&rdquo; at Lexington and Concord, in April, 1776.
Later he fought in the battles of Bunker Hill and Stoney Point. In 1793,
he returned to military service as a major with Wayne. Following the
western campaign and the building of Fort Wayne, he went to Detroit
and assisted Wayne in the formal transfer of the British post to the
Americans. He served then as commandant of Fort Defiance.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_33" href="#fn_2_33">[33]</a> Following
the western campaign of Wayne, he had been given command of
Fort Defiance. With Colonel Hunt came his family to Fort Wayne directly
from their home in Boston.</p>
<p>While at Fort Wayne, Colonel Hunt often drew criticism for his independent
action. Nevertheless, it is apparent that he devoted his energies
to the betterment of conditions at Fort Wayne, for he undertook the
responsible task of building a new fort to take the place of Wayne&rsquo;s hastily
constructed post which by 1800 was beginning to decay. The new
fort was located about three hundred feet north of the old structure and
enclosed the area of the present Old Fort Park in the city of Fort Wayne.
It seems very probable that the troops occupied the original fort during
the period of construction of the second fort, so there were two American
forts standing at the same time, separated by perhaps three hundred
feet of space. The new fort was reported to be &ldquo;large and substantial
... commanding a beautiful view of the river, as also an extent of about
four square miles of cleared land.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_34" href="#fn_2_34">[34]</a> Six log barracks for the officers and
men, a brick magazine, and smaller buildings were grouped within the
palisades around the parade ground.</p>
<p>Captain Thomas Pasteur, an officer in the Revolution and a
member of Wayne&rsquo;s corps succeeded Colonel Hunt as commander in
June, 1802. Pasteur remained but a year at Fort Wayne during which
time there was little activity at the outpost. There is some indication
from two letters written at the time that Colonel Henry Burbeck was in
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
command at Fort Wayne in the spring of 1803, although the Fort Wayne
Orderly Books give no record of this.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_35" href="#fn_2_35">[35]</a> If he did serve at Fort Wayne,
his stay was no longer than that of his successor, Major Zebulon Pike,
who remained less than two months. Major Pike was the father of the
noted explorer of the southwest, Zebulon M. Pike. The Major who was
in poor health was given command of Fort Wayne in the hope that the
position would be an easy one, as well as furnish an increase in his pay.
The command did not meet Pike&rsquo;s expectations, since his nature was
such that the constant drunkenness of the men under him was more than
he could stand. His rigid attitude in regard to temperance was revealed
in a letter to Colonel Kingsbury while both were serving at Detroit. In it
he declines an invitation of the Colonel to attend an officers&rsquo; party at
which he believes some alcoholic drink would be served.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_36" href="#fn_2_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>Major Pike&rsquo;s successor, Captain John Whipple, arrived at Fort
Wayne in September, 1803. A group of Quakers visiting Fort Wayne in
1804 reported that Captain Whipple, &ldquo;behaved with a freedom and gentility
becoming a well breed [sic] man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_37" href="#fn_2_37">[37]</a> That he was a man of fair intellectual
talents is shown by the nature of the entries in the Fort Wayne
Orderly Books during his administration. In 1804, Captain Whipple
journeyed to Detroit to bring back his wife, the former Archange Pelletier,
a descendant of the oldest family of Detroit, Francois Pelletier
having preceded Cadillac to that spot by two years.</p>
<p>After serving almost four years at Fort Wayne, Captain Whipple
resigned on January 31, 1807 and in his stead Captain Nathan Heald
was appointed as commander. Captain Heald remained at Fort Wayne
until May 16, 1810, on which day he left to take command at Fort
Dearborn (Chicago), being in charge of that garrison on the day of the
fateful massacre, August 15, 1812. During his stay at Fort Wayne, Captain
Heald met the niece of William Wells, Rebeckah Wells, whom he
later married. Captain Heald was replaced at Fort Wayne by Captain
James Rhea, an unfortunate choice for the troublesome days that were to
come during the crucial first year of the War of 1812.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_38" href="#fn_2_38">[38]</a></p>
<p>From the beginning of Colonel Hunt&rsquo;s administration in 1798 to the
end of Captain Heald&rsquo;s in 1810, the frontier was comparatively peaceful,
especially until 1807. In that year signs of the forthcoming Indian
difficulties began to appear, although the actual conflict did not break
out until 1811, with the battle of Tippecanoe. In August 1796, Winthrop
Sargent, the Secretary of the Northwest Territory, proclaimed the organization
of Wayne county, with Fort Wayne on its southern boundary.
This original Wayne county was divided into four townships, bearing
the names of Detroit, Mackinaw, Sargent, and Hamtramck, with the region
of Fort Wayne and the Maumee valley included in the latter. In October,
1799, William Henry Harrison was elected to represent the
Northwest Territory in Congress. This body, on the seventh of May,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
1800, created the Territory of Indiana, composed of all that part of the
territory of the United States west of a line beginning at the Ohio river
opposite the mouth of the Kentucky river and running northward to the
straits of Mackinac. Five days later William Henry Harrison was appointed
governor of the newly created territory. Vincennes in the southern
part of the territory, situated on the Wabash river, became the capital.</p>
<p>Up north, Fort Wayne, already an important post in the defense of
the Northwest Territory, also became a government outpost of diplomacy
and trade with the Indians. By 1798, the United States government
had established an Indian agency at Fort Wayne. The Office of Indian
Affairs was a division of the War Department from 1789 to 1849,
and was under the direction of the Secretary of War. The Indian agents
were the representatives of the department among the various tribes.
This plan, to have official representatives of the government stationed
permanently among the Indians, was adopted from that used by the English
during colonial times. Captain William Wells was the logical
choice to be the first Indian agent at Fort Wayne. The military and government
officials both felt that he was deserving of some reward for his
outstanding services during and after Wayne&rsquo;s campaign in 1794-95.
Above all he was admirably suited for the position, being intimately acquainted
with the Indians of this region and being able to speak fluently
five of the Indian dialects. When Volney asked the inhabitants of Vincennes
for aid in compiling a dictionary of the Indian language, they
recommended that he consult William Wells, as Wells knew the Indian
languages better than any other man in the territory.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_39" href="#fn_2_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Wells was anxious to secure the position for it paid a
handsome salary of $1,200 a year plus some expenses, which was rather
good in those days for a government employee. Moreover, the position
gave the agent the opportunity of arranging profitable private contracts
for services and goods for the Indians. With the purpose of obtaining
the appointment, Wells secured a letter of introduction from his friend,
Colonel Hamtramck, to the Secretary of War.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_40" href="#fn_2_40">[40]</a> In all probability Wells
used this letter and other recommendations to good advantage when he
accompanied Little Turtle to Philadelphia in the winter of 1797. Upon
his return from Philadelphia, Wells wrote to Hamtramck that he &ldquo;was
encouraged and hopeful.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_41" href="#fn_2_41">[41]</a> His hopes were well founded for in the
summer of 1798, Wells received the appointment as Indian agent at Fort
Wayne.</p>
<p>Four years later, Fort Wayne was selected as the location for one of
the Indian &ldquo;factories&rdquo; then being established by the national government.
It is somewhat difficult to make a distinction between the Indian
agency and Indian factory. Strictly speaking, the factory was the place
where goods were received, stored, and distributed, where trading was
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
carried on with the Indians by the government and payments of goods
and annuities made. The factor (the government representative in charge
of the factory), therefore, dealt primarily in financial and commercial
matters. On the other hand, an Indian agent was concerned with political
matters, such as the negotiations and treaties for the cession of lands
belonging to the Indians. It was his duty to see that the tribes remained
friendly to the United States and to report any grievances and discontent.
The distinction between the respective positions, however, was one
more in theory than in fact. That the agent&rsquo;s and factor&rsquo;s duties would
overlap is fairly obvious, even if they would have been clearly defined
and adhered to. Any political negotiation of the government with the Indians
called for payment in money and goods to the Indians, often for a
number of years, as well as at the time of the treaty. One of the main
causes of Indian dissatisfaction which the agent had to meet was that
caused by the poor quality of goods sometime furnished at the Indian
factories.</p>
<p>In theory, both the agent and the factor at Fort Wayne were responsible
to their immediate superior, Governor Harrison, as commander of
military forces and superintendent of Indian affairs in Indiana Territory.
However, those agents, such as Wells, who held their positions prior to
the creation of the territory continued to deal directly with the Secretary
of War as well as with the Governor. Benjamin Stickney, Wells&rsquo; successor
as agent, refused to recognize Harrison&rsquo;s authority over him. The
factor also received his orders from the Governor and the Secretary of
War. More directly he was under the Superintendent of Indian Trade, an
official answerable to both the Secretary of War and Congress. During
the years before the War of 1812, the post of Superintendent of Indian
Trade was held consecutively by William Irvine and John Mason. This
lack of central authority pertaining to the factories and agencies only
served to add to the confusion already created by the nature of the positions.
At a later date, the agent assumed the duties of the factor and the
latter term fell into disuse, but until the factory was destroyed by the
Indians at Fort Wayne, the two positions remained separate and from the
start, difficult to harmonize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; John Johnston served as the first Indian factor at Fort
Wayne from 1802 to 1811. Johnston, a prominent figure in the northwest,
during his lifetime served thirty-one years with the Department of
Indian Affairs. He was born in Ireland on March 22, 1775, and came to
America at the age of eleven. A few years later, while yet a youth, he
undertook the job of driving supply wagons to Wayne&rsquo;s army. After receiving
his appointment as factor for Fort Wayne, Johnston married
sixteen-year-old Rachel Robinson at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, much
against the desire of the young girl&rsquo;s parents. The Johnstons&rsquo; wedding
trip consisted of the journey by horseback through the wilderness to Fort
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Wayne. While living at Fort Wayne, Colonel Johnston and his wife were
noted for their stern rectitude, which contrasted considerably with the
type of life generally found at this military outpost. In later life,
Johnston, for his years of government service, became known as &ldquo;Colonel
Johnston&rdquo;. He is described as &ldquo;six feet and more in height, very
erect, in his bearing and he had a blond complexion inclined to
ruddy.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_42" href="#fn_2_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Besides his duties as factor, Colonel Johnston occasionally served
as assistant surgeon at the fort. For his position as factor, Johnston received
a salary of $1,000 a year from the government and $365 for subsistence.
The latter amount was funded by the profits of the factory. In
1810, William Oliver was appointed to the Fort Wayne factory to serve
as Johnston&rsquo;s assistant. When Oliver resigned in 1812, Johnston secured
the position for his brother, Stephen Johnston.</p>
<p>As factor, Johnston aimed at being just to the Indians and loyal to
his government, a combination of purpose attended with many difficulties.
In a report to the Secretary of War, Johnston pointed out that the
trading houses with the northern Indians never produced any political effect
in favor of the Americans, as had been expected when they were
established. Rather, on the contrary, the Indians were led to believe that
the object was to make money; and in as much as the government goods
were never sold cheaper than those of the private traders, it was impossible
to produce a different impression.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_43" href="#fn_2_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>Johnston had trouble procuring the proper kinds of supplies to issue
to the Indians at Fort Wayne. The goods intended for the Indian trade
were rarely imported into the United States, there being no regular demand
for them. On the other hand, the British traders in Canada had
agents in England, long accustomed to this commerce, who sent out the
very articles needed. The supplies destined for the United States factories
went through many hands, and this offered countless opportunities
to defraud the Indians and the government. Often the goods came out of
season or were damaged. Johnston constantly urged that the trade either
be put in the hands of private traders who would be licensed by the
government, or, if the government thought it necessary to stay in the
business, an expert should be sent to England to do the purchasing of
the Indian articles. Typical of the goods used by the Indians are the following
items listed in Johnston&rsquo;s record book, &ldquo;blankets, strouds, [a
coarse Indian blanket] hat bands, head bands, Indian mats, kettles, pans,
rings, cloth of various color, wampum, broaches, scalping knives, fish
hooks, and tobacco.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_44" href="#fn_2_44">[44]</a> Johnston also complained that the military were
generally unfriendly to his trading post and even hindered his work at
times. Apparently this ill feeling was caused by the fact that the soldiers
did not consider it a part of their business to furnish transportation for
the furs and Indian goods or to erect the necessary buildings for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
trade at Fort Wayne.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_45" href="#fn_2_45">[45]</a> On one occasion, the factor lost in Lake Erie
$2,300 worth of furs. Johnston claimed that the accident came about
through the carelessness of a drunken non-commissioned officer, Joseph
McMahan, although McMahan was excused of all responsibility by a
court martial.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_46" href="#fn_2_46">[46]</a> The result of the trial provoked Johnston so much that
he protested to the Superintendent of Indian Trade, but nothing could be
done.</p>
<p>During the decade of its existence prior to the War of 1812, the
Fort Wayne factory was the most prosperous of all the trading houses established
by the United States government. A report submitted by the
Secretary of War to Congress showed that in the three years and ten
months preceding January 13, 1812, the Fort Wayne factory made a profit
of $10,502.77. This was by far the largest profit shown by any of
the ten factories then operated throughout the nation.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_47" href="#fn_2_47">[47]</a> Another report
shows that the fur and peltries received from the Indians at the Fort
Wayne factory sold for $27,547.07.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_48" href="#fn_2_48">[48]</a> While the government did only a
small fraction of the fur trading, this is a good indication that the fur
trade of the Maumee and Wabash valleys which led the French to fortify
the spot was still the principal economic asset of Fort Wayne. Colonel
Johnston&rsquo;s account books suggest that the once abundant beaver skins
were becoming scarce. Instead of beaver, racoon and deer skins were
being shipped in great quantities.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_49" href="#fn_2_49">[49]</a> These furs were carried by way of
Lake Erie to New York and Philadelphia, where they were sold at auctions.
Most of the furs obtained from the private traders were taken to
Detroit where they were purchased by the American Fur Company.
Skins were worth deer, $1.25; raccoon, $.50; bear, $3.00 to $5.00.
These values were nominal, as the price fluctuated and the furs were
paid for in goods which were passed off on the Indians for more than
double the initial cost and transportation.</p>
<p>In order to transport the skins, they were dried, compressed, and
secured in packs. Each pack weighed about 100 pounds. A pirogue or
boat, that was sufficiently large to carry forty packs, required the labor
of four men to manage it on its voyage. In favorable stages of the river,
such a vessel, under the management of skilled boatmen, was propelled
by poles fifteen or twenty miles a day, against the current. On the return
trips the pirogues were loaded with merchandise to be sold to the Indians.</p>
<p>Turning our attention once more to Indian treaties and their resulting
difficulties, important events centered about Fort Wayne between the
years 1800 and 1809. The year 1800 in which William Henry Harrison
was appointed the first governor of the Indiana Territory was one of
peace in the Great Lake region of the United States. The British had
evacuated the posts they had held in the northwest, according to the agreement
in the Jay treaty, and the Indians appeared content. At Fort
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Wayne, the future appeared so calm that William Wells wrote to Hamtramck
that he expected the garrison to be withdrawn shortly.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_50" href="#fn_2_50">[50]</a> However,
the spark that set off the flames of Indian warfare was soon to be
ignited and kept aglow by British intrigue. This spark was the never ending
demand for new lands by the western settlers, which resulted in the
attempts of the government to satisfy this demand by gaining new land
cessions from the Indians.</p>
<p>Governor Harrison, on assuming his office, proceeded promptly to
enter into treaty agreements with the Indians for the purchase of their
large tracts of land in what are now the states of Indiana and Illinois.
This was in accordance with President Jefferson&rsquo;s objective, the acquisition
from the Indians of the whole territory east of the Mississippi. Harrison
sent word to the Indians to meet him at Fort Wayne in the summer
of 1803 for the first of his important treaty councils. By June 7 of that
year, he completed his task, having secured from the Eel River Miamis,
Kaskaskia, Kickapoo, Piankashaw, and Wea tribes a large tract of land
around Vincennes, as well as the valuable salt spring on the Saline
Creek. This treaty had been brought to a successful conclusion for the
United States through a combination of Harrison&rsquo;s shrewdness and stubbornness
in bargaining, the financial backing of the factory at Fort
Wayne, and the influence of Capt. Wells over Little Turtle. Although
Harrison and Johnston obtained the cooperation of Wells in gaining the
consent of the Indians, the agent, for the most part, strove against any
cession of lands by the Indians. Wells went so far as to instigate the Indians
to protest to the national government against a treaty Harrison
concluded with the Delawares and Piankashaws the following year.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_51" href="#fn_2_51">[51]</a></p>
<p>Between Colonel Johnston, the factor, and Wells, the agent, there
was no coordination of purpose or even good will. Outside of the fact
that the conflicting duties of their respective positions involved them in
quarrels, Wells and Johnston seemed to have been mutually antagonistic,
and each put the worst interpretation on the other&rsquo;s actions when
writing to their superiors. Wells felt that Johnston&rsquo;s policy of trying to
win an active alliance with the Indians for the United States in the event
of war with Great Britain was in effect evidence of Johnston&rsquo;s gullibility
in dealing with the red men. Even after the battle of Tippecanoe,
Johnston gave arms and ammunition to the Indians who had participated
in the affair. Wells knew the Indians well, and realized that in the event
of war the best that could be expected would be that they would remain
neutral. On the other hand, Johnston felt that Wells was completely unprincipled
and could not be trusted.</p>
<p>Johnston&rsquo;s opinion of Wells was shared by Governor Harrison, who
nevertheless realized the agent&rsquo;s great ability in dealing with the Indians.
Harrison wrote of Wells on one occasion, &ldquo;My knowledge of his
character induces me to believe that he will go any length and use any
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
means to carry a favorite point and much mischief may ensue from his
knowledge of the Indians, his cunning and perservance.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_52" href="#fn_2_52">[52]</a> In all matters,
Wells and Little Turtle were in agreement, and while the latter&rsquo;s influence
with his fellow tribesmen had diminished considerably with the
rise of a new generation, he was still a force to be reckoned with in any
treaty negotiations. It is almost certain that neither Wells or Little Turtle
intended to arouse the Indians to war against the advance of the tide of
settlers, yet they were ready to oppose Harrison&rsquo;s objectives at the various
treaty councils.</p>
<p>Although Harrison indicated in his correspondence with the Secretary
of War that he knew the reasons behind Wells&rsquo; action in opposing
most of the land cessions, the Governor&rsquo;s letters do not definitely reveal
what he meant. In an indefinite manner, Harrison ascribed the reason
for Wells&rsquo; action to the agent&rsquo;s attachment for Little Turtle, mingled
with a jealousy of the Governor. Harrison apparently felt that Wells had
a personal animosity toward him, and that Wells&rsquo; opposition was intended
to discredit him.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_53" href="#fn_2_53">[53]</a> In one letter to the Secretary of War Harrison
suggested that Wells was profiting dishonestly from his position as Indian
agent at Fort Wayne. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am really of the opinion that the Turtle, the Five Medals, and two
or three others receive much the greater part of the annuities and provisions
which are intended for and said to be given to the
Potawatomies and Miamis and I am by no means certain that Wells
himself does not largely participate. The fact is admitted that he makes
more money than any other man in the Territory. Mr. Johnston told
Col. Vigo that he [Wells] cleared last upwards of $6000. How he can
do this honestly I am at a loss to know.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_54" href="#fn_2_54">[54]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning the reason for Little Turtle&rsquo;s opposition to further land
cessions on the part of the Indians, Harrison is more definite in his convictions.
In 1803, the Governor wrote of Little Turtle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Conscious of his superiority of his Talents over the rest of his race
and colour he sighs for a more conspicuous theatre to display them.
Opportunities for exhibiting his eloquence occur too seldom to satisfy
his vanity.... A chosen connexion among the neighbouring Tribes
and a regular convention of their chiefs has been long the ruling wish
of his heart and the object of numberless intrigues.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_55" href="#fn_2_55">[55]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming that Harrison was correct about Little Turtle&rsquo;s ambition
to form an Indian confederation, it is interesting to observe that had the
Miami chief succeeded rather than Tecumseh, the league formed would
have been inclined toward peace rather than war with the United States.
Following the Treaty of Greenville Little Turtle often objected to further
cessions of land, yet, at the same time, he endeavored to induce the red
men to lay aside the tomahawk and scalping knife and take up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
peaceful tools of agriculture. This fact made him unacceptable to the
majority of Indians, as Harrison himself admitted at a later date. &ldquo;It
was the rock upon which the popularity of Tecumseh was founded&rdquo;, he
wrote, &ldquo;and that upon which the influence of Little Turtle was
wrecked.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_56" href="#fn_2_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>The truth of this assertion is made plain in the report of the visit of
two Quakers who, in response to an appeal by Little Turtle, came to
Fort Wayne in 1804 to attempt to introduce the best methods of agriculture
among the Indians. From the official report of Gerard T. Hopkins to
his church, the story as here reviewed has been obtained.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_57" href="#fn_2_57">[57]</a> Mr. Hopkins
was accompanied by George Ellicott, also of the Society of Friends, and
Philip Dennis, a practical farmer who was engaged to serve as instructor.</p>
<p>The Quakers arrived at Fort Wayne on March 30 and were conducted
to Captain Whipple, then commandant of the fort, to whom they
presented a letter of introduction and recommendation from Henry
Dearborn, Secretary of War. This letter was a liberal commendation of
the committee and their motives. General Dearborn was personally acquainted
with the members of the committee, was in hearty sympathy
with their mission, and rode on horseback from Washington to Ellicott&rsquo;s
home, a distance of forty miles to present the letter to the committee before
leaving.</p>
<p>The Quakers were surprised to find that no attention was given,
either in the fort or the Indian village, to the proper observance of the
Sabbath day. The Friends were entertained by John Johnston, and there
the chiefs took supper with the mission committee. Under the guidance
of Captain Wells the following days, the Friends went over the lands
most suitable for cultivation, and at the same time observed the most
historic places and listened to the stories as told by Wells of the Indian
villages and of Harmar&rsquo;s and St. Clair&rsquo;s defeats.</p>
<p>The rides to the country included visits to large sugar camps and
the &ldquo;prairie&rdquo; between the St. Mary&rsquo;s and Little River, the distance from
one to the other being but four miles in the then swampy land; and the
watershed ridge but five feet high with reports of canoes passing over in
highest stages of water. The subject of a canal through this ridge was
also mentioned. Indians were constantly coming and going, the women
carrying the burdens of packs of skins and bark boxes of maple sugar
each weighing about fifty pounds.</p>
<p>The next day Little Turtle and the other chiefs assembled at the
home of Captain Wells, and there arrangements were made for Dennis
to remain with the Indians and establish a farm. The attempt to educate
the Indians to till the soil was undertaken at a point on the Wabash river
about twenty miles southwest of Fort Wayne. After the departure of the
Quakers, Dennis continued his efforts but only one or, at the most, two
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
of the Indians could be induced to help him. After a year, Dennis returned
to Maryland, and as no one could be induced to take his place
the project was left in the hands of Wells, who had a contract to supply
the Indians with fence rails for the farms.</p>
<p>The Indians were in no mood to give their attention to the tilling of
the soil. Trouble of a subdued nature portended serious conflicts for the
future. On April 26, 1805, Harrison wrote to the Secretary of War that
he felt it was necessary for him to proceed to Fort Wayne to investigate
the complaints arising from the Indians threat. These complaints centered
chiefly around the treaty concluded with the Delawares and Piankashaws
in 1804. The Miamis maintained that they should have shared
in the benefits of the treaty as part owners of the land sold, while the
Delawares felt that they had not received enough in the way of annuities
for the land. Harrison suspected that these complaints arose primarily
through the instigation of Wells and Little Turtle and had determined to
investigate Wells&rsquo; activities as well as the grievances.</p>
<p>Harrison, however, decided not to go personally to Fort Wayne,
explaining that it &ldquo;would be a sacrifice of that dignity and authority
which is necessary to observe in all our transactions with the Indians.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_58" href="#fn_2_58">[58]</a>
In his stead, Harrison dispatched General John Gibson, secretary
of Indiana Territory and Colonel Francis Vigo,<a class="fn" id="fr_2_59" href="#fn_2_59">[59]</a> who on their arrival met
strong opposition from Wells and Little Turtle. These two, viewing the visit
of Gibson and Vigo with evident suspicion, addressed a letter to the former
in which they demanded his credentials. Lieutenant Brownson, in temporary
command of Fort Wayne, remarked to the Governor&rsquo;s agents that he had
heard Wells repeatedly say the Indians were very much imposed on in the
late treaty. In a private conversation the Miami chief, Richardville, told
Colonel Vigo that he was quite surprised to hear an officer who had taken an
oath to support the Government of the United States, express himself in the
manner Wells had. Richardville also informed them that the Little Turtle, in
the presence of Wells, had produced a paper and requested Richardville to
sign it. Being a remonstrance in favor of Wells, Richardville refused to sign
it, saying, &ldquo;if Mr. Wells had behaved well there was no occasion to write to
the president in his favour that he did not wish to interfere in matters which
belonged entirely to the White people, and that he, the Little Turtle, had
frequently wrote letters to the president, without their being consulted or
asked to sign them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_60" href="#fn_2_60">[60]</a></p>
<p>Vigo and Gibson were convinced that a certain Peter Audrian had
conspired with Wells and Little Turtle in the affair. Audrian was an influential
French trader at Detroit, who during his lifetime held the governmental
positions of judge, prothonotary, and land commissioner. At
this time he had an advantageous contract from Wells to furnish the log
rails for the farms of the Indians. In one year alone the Indians purchased
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
63,000 rails from Audrian, many more than were actually
needed.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_61" href="#fn_2_61">[61]</a></p>
<p>In their report to Governor Harrison, Gibson and Vigo concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... no noise or clamor respecting the treaty last summer with the
Delawares ... would have been made had it not been occasioned by
the Little Turtle and Wells, the latter of whom seems more attentive
to the Indians than the people of the United States.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_62" href="#fn_2_62">[62]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his report to the Secretary of War, Harrison added that Wells&rsquo;
services were highly useful and that he discharged his duties on occasions
with great zeal and industry. Early in August, 1805, Wells, accompanied
by Little Turtle, came to Vincennes. &ldquo;Both are here,&rdquo; wrote
Harrison to Dearborn, &ldquo;and I have received from each a positive assurance
of a friendly dispostion as well toward the government as myself
individually. With Captain Wells, I have had an explanation, and have
agreed to a general amnesty and act of oblivion for the past.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_63" href="#fn_2_63">[63]</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this seemingly peaceful settlement of the difficulty,
the official relationship between Wells and the governor remained
strained, and we find Harrison as late as April 23, 1811, writing to the
new Secretary of War, Eustis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I be allowed to dispose of Wells as I thought proper, my first
wish would be to place him in the interiour of our settlement where
he would never see and scarcely hear of an Indian. But as this is impossible,
from his being located in such a manner at Fort Wayne, that
he cannot be removed without a very considerable expense, my next
wish is to get such an appointment as he could consider an object,
where he might be used to advantage, but at the same time so limited
as to prevent his doing mischief.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_64" href="#fn_2_64">[64]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Governor Harrison was doing his utmost to secure more territory
from the Indians, he did not wish the newly purchased lands to
fall into the hands of unscrupulous traders who used the bargaining
power of whiskey to rob the Indians of their furs. This was especially
true of the United States land around Fort Wayne, which was too distant
from Vincennes to be under his effective control. When, in 1805, Harrison
heard that it was intended to sell the government land around Fort
Wayne immediately, he objected strongly. &ldquo;I am very certain,&rdquo; he
wrote to the Secretary of War, &ldquo;that the money which will be put into
the Treasury by the sale of it will not counterbalance the inconveniences
which will arise from having it settled with the description of people
who will naturally buy it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_65" href="#fn_2_65">[65]</a> He then pointed out that Fort Wayne was
too far removed from any other settlement to entice American farmers to
go there, and in all probability, only Indian traders would buy the land
and would thus be out of the reach of the laws of the United States regulating
Indian trade and commerce. He conceded that the Fort Wayne
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
was fertile enough for farming and concluded by saying, &ldquo;If the immediate
settlement of it is an object I think it would be better to sell it
by contract upon the condition that there would be within a given time a
certain number of American farmers upon it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_66" href="#fn_2_66">[66]</a></p>
<p>The government officials apparently accepted Harrison&rsquo;s advice
since the proposal to sell the Fort Wayne lands was laid aside. It is fortunate
that this land was not sold, for it is unlikely that any farmers
would have been attracted to this remote spot in northern Indiana during
the forthcoming years of Indian difficulties on the frontier. If any
settlers had come, it is doubtful that they could have survived the War
of 1812. Consequently, Fort Wayne was destined to remain until the end
of that war primarily a government outpost of diplomacy, defense, and
trade, represented by the Indian agency, the military garrison, and the
government factory. There were a few farms of value, such as those of
Wells and the officers, but while the land was fertile, the market was
too distant for the crops to bring any considerable return. The civilians
living in the neighborhood were, for the most part, French families who
still found the fur trade profitable, along with a few American traders
and sutlers. None of these people held any title to the lands they occupied.</p>

<br />The Impending Conflict</h2>
<p>A dozen years had passed since the battle of Fallen Timbers and
the defeat suffered by the Indians at that time was growing dim in their
memories. English traders and military officials at Malden encouraged
the red men to strike once again the Americans who were fast turning
their hunting lands into farms and settlements. The occasion awaited
only a second Pontiac. That leader came in the person of Tecumseh, the
Shawnee. Tecumseh saw his race driven from their native land, their
morals debased, their independence destroyed, and their means of subsistence
cut off. He looked for the cause of these evils, and believed he
found it in the flood of white immigration.</p>
<p>With Tecumseh came his brother Elskwatwa, better known as &ldquo;the
Prophet&rdquo;. The Prophet prophesied the resurgence of the Indians, and although
his character was not as great as Tecumseh&rsquo;s, for a time he overshadowed
Tecumseh. As Pontiac had conspired against the British, so
Tecumseh and the Prophet came to destroy the Americans. Unfortunately
for the white settlers on the frontier, their great scheme neared its
climax simultaneously with the outbreak of war between the United
States and Great Britain.</p>
<p>The small outpost at Fort Wayne was to play an important part in
the events preceding the conflict as well as in the war itself. Captain
Wells, through his close acquaintanceship with the Indians, kept well informed
of conditions. He was the first to notify the Secretary of War,
Dearborn, of the new danger emanating from the Prophet&rsquo;s power.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_1" href="#fn_3_1">[1]</a> In
June, 1807, Wells reported that a sort of religious madness had spread
among the Indians. A constant stream of warriors had passed Fort
Wayne, on the way to the Prophet during April and May; at least 1,500,
he estimated, had made the pilgrimage to Greenville, and many more
were due in August and September, after the Indian crops had ripened.
A month later he wrote to Governor Harrison:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two confidential Indians that I sent to that quarter [Mackinac] have
returned today and say that all the Indians in that quarter believe in
what the Prophet tells them.... I am also informed by a letter from
Detroit that the inhabitants of that place are fortifying themselves. We
are all alarmed at this place, myself excepted, as I can see no danger
as yet at our doors. Something must be done. It cannot be done too
soon.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_2" href="#fn_3_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Wells had sized up the situation correctly. The threat was real and
dangerous, but not immediate. That winter he informed Harrison that
there was a very unusual assemblage of Potawatomis in the vicinity of
Fort Wayne; however, he added that he thought their intentions were
pacific. Harrison was not so certain of their friendly intentions and requested
Wells to send two or three chiefs to him that he might ascertain
their true purpose. The Secretary of War was even more alarmed at the
news, and he urged Harrison to visit Fort Wayne in order to find out
their real object. Dearborn also mistrusted Wells, who, he thought, was
&ldquo;too attentive to pecuniary considerations.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_3" href="#fn_3_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Despite the reports of dissatisfaction with the conduct of Wells by
his superiors, Harrison and Dearborn, Congress, in 1808, in recognition
of his past services, granted him the right of pre-emption to one section
of land in the present Spy Run and Bloomingdale districts of Fort
Wayne at $1.25 an acre. It was in this section that Wells had already established
his farm. Wells died before he could pre-empt the land, but his
children took advantage of the government&rsquo;s offer and entered the property
in 1823.</p>
<p>To Fort Wayne, in September, 1809, came Governor Harrison, in
spite of the threatening conditions of the community, to make what
proved to be his final treaty with the Indians in Indiana Territory. The
scene that was enacted was a memorable one. On the one side were arrayed
the Governor with his servant, his secretary, four Indian interpreters,
and the officers of the fort; on the other, the painted warriors of
the Miamis, the Potawatomis, the Delawares, and the Weas. On the
third day of the council, 892 warriors were present, on the day of actual
signing of the treaty, 1,390 were there.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_4" href="#fn_3_4">[4]</a> Never before had such a large
number of Indians been assembled to meet a commissioner of the United
States. There were enough supplies on hand to meet this unexpected
demand, although the garrison lacked necessary provisions for some
time afterward.</p>
<p>By adroit maneuvering and clever diplomacy, Governor Harrison
secured his objective. The agreement, signed on the 17th of September,
added to the domain of the United States an area of 2,900,000 acres,
the greater portion of which was situated north of the old Vincennes
tract. For this were exchanged the usual annuities to be paid to the Indians,
a great deal of these being in the form of domestic animals to be
delivered at Fort Wayne. Moreover, an armorer was to be employed at
Fort Wayne for the benefit of the Indians. The result of the treaty had
little direct effect on Fort Wayne, other than making it possible for the
line of civilization to move closer to it.</p>
<p>In connection with the treaty of Fort Wayne, the complex question
of Captain Wells arose once more to plague the Governor. On April 8,
1809, prior to Harrison&rsquo;s coming to Fort Wayne, Wells wrote to him in
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
detail concerning the activities of the Prophet. In the letter Wells offered
his assistance in forthcoming treaty negotiations.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_5" href="#fn_3_5">[5]</a> Two weeks after writing
this letter, Wells was dismissed as Indian agent at Fort Wayne by
Secretary of War, Dearborn. This was shortly before the latter left the
War Department. Apparently General Dearborn believed that Wells did
not always use the public funds for the best interest of the government.
The surprising fact is that Harrison, supposedly the immediate superior
of Wells, first learned of the agent&rsquo;s dismissal when he arrived at Fort
Wayne to negotiate the treaty. Harrison was surprised and also a little
angered at not being consulted in the matter.</p>
<p>Upon the governor&rsquo;s arrival, Wells solicited Harrison&rsquo;s intervention
in his behalf and again tendered his aid in bringing the contemplated
treaty to a successful conclusion. After the treaty was signed, and while
he was still at Fort Wayne, Harrison wrote to William Eustis, Dearborn&rsquo;s
successor about the matter, saying that Wells had rendered most
essential services during the negotiations. Harrison then added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He [Wells] professes himself to be unconscious of any crime which
merits the treatment he has received. I think from his former services
he deserves a hearing, and if his removal has been occasioned by
misrepresentations, and a vacancy should occur in the Indian Department
the government would find it to their account in placing him in
it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_6" href="#fn_3_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back at Vincennes, two months later, Harrison wrote to Eustis in a
somewhat different tone. First he gave a detailed account of Wells&rsquo;
career, mentioning his natural abilities as well as the defects in his
character. Harrison then said that since the treaty of Fort Wayne, Wells&rsquo;
conduct was so unfavorable that it did away with all favorable impressions
which his zeal for the treaty had created. However, he concluded
that it would be better to employ Wells in some position within the Department
than not to make use of him at all.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_7" href="#fn_3_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Having heard that Wells might be reinstated in the Indian Department,
John Johnston, Wells&rsquo; bitterest enemy at Fort Wayne, wrote immediately
to Harrison saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you will have to give up all idea of taking up &mdash;&mdash;
[Johnston usually referred to Wells by a dash in the letter] again. He
is too unprincipled to be employed anywhere, except as an interpreter,
and under your own eye.... I could detail to you a thousand instances
of his total disregard of everything that is held sacred by honest
and honorable men. Admitting he was restored here again ... he
would be useless to you and the government; for the latter never
would put any confidence in his representations, and the public interest
would thereby suffer. He has so long travelled in the crooked,
miry paths of intrigue and deception, that he never could be made to
retrace his steps, and pursue a straight, fair, and honorable course,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
such as might be creditable to himself and useful to his country. My
opinion of him is made up from a long residence at this post, and an
intimate knowledge of his character, both public and private ... the
sooner all hope of his reestablishment is at an end, it will be the better,
for he is becoming a pest here, and will move off if he finds he
cannot be reinstated.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_8" href="#fn_3_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under Article 9 of the treaty of Fort Wayne, part of the land cession
of the Indians was valid only with the consent of the Kickapoo
tribe. On December 9, they signed a separate treaty and in it added
another tract this time subject to the consent of the Miamis. Johnston
accused Wells and Little Turtle of stirring up opposition among the
Miamis against the new cession of land.</p>
<p>Harrison&rsquo;s displeasure with Wells became more intense when he
learned that a false story was circulated among the Indians around Fort
Wayne after the treaty, charging Harrison with buying the lands for his
own use and that of the people of Vincennes. What part Wells played in
this is not clear. Harrison believed him to be to a large extent responsible,
primarily by acting as an agent for William McIntosh, a Scotch
Tory. McIntosh was eager to prevent the settling of the new land, as he
had acquired title to it from the French at Vincennes.</p>
<p>The situation was made even more delicate and dangerous by the
fact that Tecumseh and the Prophet refused absolutely to recognize the
validity of the Fort Wayne treaty.</p>
<p>In October, the Indians were called to Fort Wayne on Harrison&rsquo;s
order, in order that Johnston might stop the spread of false stories circulating
about the treaty. During the council, Johnston brought up the
question that he found was being agitated among the Indians, that is petitioning
for the removal of Governor Harrison, on the grounds of misconduct
in office. Johnston thought that Wells was the one responsible
for the petition, and told the Indians, &ldquo;that whoever advised them to it
was a wicked bad man and not their friend.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_9" href="#fn_3_9">[9]</a> The Owl, a Miami chief,
maintained that all the mischief going on among them had sprung from
Wells and Little Turtle. Johnston also reported that Wells had gone to
Washington in an attempt to regain his old position as Indian agent, and
Johnston hoped that if Wells failed, he would leave Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>Johnston&rsquo;s report confirmed Harrison in his belief that Wells was
acting as an agent for William McIntosh, by spreading the false stories
concerning the governor&rsquo;s relations with the tribes. The question of
Wells&rsquo; connection with McIntosh deserves some attention as the quarrel
between McIntosh and Harrison was more than one of mere personalities.
Their dispute was involved in that of the land speculators and
Indian traders on the one hand and the government authority, represented
primarily by the governor, on the other. Harrison did all in his
power to check the purchase of the Indian lands by speculators and traders.
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
It has been noted above that he prevented the sale of the Fort
Wayne lands owned by the government for fear of these lands being
purchased by unscrupulous traders. It is possible that Wells fell in line
with McIntosh in the latter&rsquo;s quarrel with the governor. Johnston hints
that Wells was eager to trade with the Indians himself, and it is to be
remembered that Wells and Peter Audrian tried to prevent the execution of
the treaty with the Delawares in 1805.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_10" href="#fn_3_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>In the fall of 1810, Harrison brought a libel suit against William
McIntosh for slander in regard to the alleged misconduct in the treaty
negotiations and general mismanagement of the Indian affairs in the territory
on the part of the governor. The trial became a test between the
land speculators and Indian traders and Harrison. By the time the trial
was over, it included a complete examination of Harrison&rsquo;s conduct as
territorial governor. Connected with the affair were the &ldquo;Letters of Decius&rdquo;,
a series of attacks on the governor by an Irish lawyer, Isaac Darneille.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_11" href="#fn_3_11">[11]</a>
Considerable attention was directed to the trial throughout the
Northwest; the Cincinnati and Frankfort papers carried lengthy accounts
of it. The jury gave a verdict in favor of Harrison, and granted him
damages of four thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In respect to Wells, it is surprising to learn that he testified at the
trial in behalf of Harrison, stating that he found the governor&rsquo;s manner
of dealing with the Indians in the councils at all times just. At first
glance, it would seem as though Harrison had been wrong in accusing
Wells of scheming with McIntosh, and it is possible that Harrison may
have been. However, such a contradiction of previous action is in keeping
with the pattern of Wells&rsquo; character and life. William Wells was undoubtedly
an intelligent and shrewd man, but with this ability was combined
a capacity for intrigue for his own benefit, which prevented his
superiors from relying on him and most of the Indians in his later life
from trusting in him. In trying to play the part of a &ldquo;Talleyrand&rdquo; in Indian
affairs, Wells failed miserably. Why he chose this manner of accomplishing
his purposes is unknown. Possibly his connection with
both the white and red races prompted him to believe himself a
mediator, who, incidentally, could profit by the differences between the
two.</p>
<p>Wells had many enemies and a few friends among both races. If
there is any value in the observation, it is to be noted that most of his
friends were made in his early life, while his enemies were made after
he became Indian agent at Fort Wayne. Among the Indians, Little Turtle
was Wells&rsquo; most intimate associate, although Five Medals, Blue Jacket,
and many of the older chiefs were also counted among his friends.
Richardville, one of the shrewdest of the Miamis, did not trust Wells.
The Prophet and Tecumseh, as well as Winamac and the White Loon
hated Wells. Harrison admitted shortly before Wells&rsquo; unexpected death
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
that Wells deserved some credit from the circumstance that the line that
separated his friends among the chiefs from his enemies was precisely
the same as one Harrison would have designated to separate the friends
of the American cause from its enemies.</p>
<p>Among Wells&rsquo; white friends were General Wayne, who valued his
services immensely, and Colonel Hamtramck, who was also Wells&rsquo; business
associate. Other commanders at Fort Wayne, notably Captain
Heald thought highly of him. On the other hand, his superiors&mdash;Harrison,
Dearborn, and Eustis&mdash;felt that he was unfaithful and not
worthy of their trust, while John Johnston despised him.</p>
<p>Considering all this, it is no wonder that Harrison wrote to the Secretary
of War in one of his last letters concerning William Wells:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If my letters and opinions on the subject of Wells have appeared to
you in any degree inconsistent and contradictory I can not say that
they have not exhibited a faithful presentation of what has passed in
my mind. You will do me justice in believing that this has not proceeded
from fickleness of temper or any less worthy cause but from
the contradictory impressions which a knowledge of his superior talents
for an appointment in the Indian Department and the fear of his
possessing dispositions which might in some degree prove dangerous,
have made upon me. Without troubling you again with observations
upon his character which I have before frequently made I will merely
mention the conclusions which my mind has arrived at after much reflection.
Could I be allowed to dispose of Wells as I thought proper
my first wish would be to place him in the Interiour of our settlements
where he would never see and scarely hear of an Indian. But
as this is impossible from his being located in such a manner at Fort
Wayne, that he cannot be removed without very considerable expence
my next wish is to get him such an appointment as he could consider
an object where he might be used to advantage but at the same time
so limited as to prevent his doing mischief. I sincerely believe that he
would now be faithful. His activities and talents need not be
doubted.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_11a" href="#fn_3_11a">[11a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harrison still found Wells&rsquo; ability worth while and made use of this
despite the latter&rsquo;s severance from the Indian department. In April,
Wells and John Conner were sent to the Prophet&rsquo;s town to investigate
the murder of four white people in the neighborhood. Wells had a prolonged
conversation with Tecumseh during which the Shawnee openly
declared his intention to resist the white encroachments. In July, Tecumseh
came to Vincennes with a large body of Indians and once more protested
strongly against the agreements of the Fort Wayne treaty of 1809.</p>
<p>In the midst of this agitation, Captain Heald, the commander at Fort
Wayne, was transferred to the post at Fort Dearborn. Captain Heald was
followed shortly by his young bride, Rebekah Wells, the favorite niece
of William Wells. Arriving on May 15, 1810, Capt. James Rhea took
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
over the command of Fort Wayne. Rhea was a native of New Jersey,
and had received a commission in the army in 1791. He was promoted
to first lieutenant in 1800, and was commissioned a captain in 1807. He
had served with Wayne&rsquo;s army and for a time was assigned to the command
of Fort Industry on the Maumee River. Shortly before coming to
Fort Wayne, Captain Rhea married Polly Forsyth, the 18 year old daughter
of James Forsyth, a wealthy Detroit merchant.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_12" href="#fn_3_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Two days after his arrival at Fort Wayne, Captain Rhea wrote to his
superior, Colonel Kingsbury:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... I found Capt. Heald at this Place; he starts in the morning ... I
am much pleased with my Command; I hope to be continued here ...
at this Post every thing has been going on very correct; I mean to
take the Tract of Capt. Heald as near as possible ... I have been very
ill with Rheumatism Pains ever since I left you. I don&rsquo;t know if ever
I shall recover, I have not had a Night Sleep in two Weeks.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_13" href="#fn_3_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following month Captain Rhea reported that he was still suffering
a great deal from the rheumatic attacks; nevertheless during his first
year at Fort Wayne, the captain displayed the qualities of a good commander.
He made considerable repairs on the fort and carried out a
program of sanitation and land clearance. He knew of the impending
trouble with the Indians, but he failed, when the time came, to grasp
the opportunity of achieving recognition. At the critical moment, Captain
Rhea proved to be a weak character, given somewhat to alarmist
tendencies. During the siege of Fort Wayne, he displayed appalling
cowardice and a fondness for whiskey which proved his undoing.
Whether or not he sought to relieve his continued attacks of rheumatism
by alcohol can only be surmised, but his decline from the position taken
in his first garrison order at Fort Wayne to that of a slave of alcohol in
1812, forms a striking reversal. In his first order on May 20, 1810, he
noted the &ldquo;abonimable [sic] practice&rdquo; of drunkenness among the men,
and commented that he was &ldquo;much hurt to see so much intoxication.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_14" href="#fn_3_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>From the captain&rsquo;s first quarterly report for the months of April,
May, and June, 1810, we have the following information in regard to
the garrison:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Officers: Captain, James Rhea; First Lieutenant, William Whistler;
Second Lieutenant, Philip Ostrander; Composition of the Company;
Native Americans, 36; Englishmen, 1; Irishmen, 11; Frenchmen 2;
total, 50. Strength of the Company: 1 captain, 2 subalterns, 3
sergeants, 2 corporals, 3 musicians, 39 privates.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_15" href="#fn_3_15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Rhea&rsquo;s report for November was almost identical in regard
to the number of his men, but he added that the garrison was 31 men
short of its required strength of 81 men. He also felt that the arms of the
garrison were in bad condition, while on the other hand, the clothing of
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the men was in good condition and the fort was regularly supplied with
provisions and ammunition. Captain Rhea reported the discipline of the
troops to be good, but actually it could have been no better than usual,
judging from the numerous court martials recorded in the garrison orders
during his command.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_16" href="#fn_3_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>During the summer of 1811, Fort Wayne became for the Indians
the central point between the Prophet&rsquo;s Town on the Tippecanoe river
and Malden, the British post across from Detroit where arms and ammunition
were distributed to the red men. On August 11, 1811, John
Shaw, the assistant government agent at Fort Wayne, reported to the
Secretary of War that the situation in regard to the Prophet was growing
serious, and many of the neutral tribes were coming to him for advice.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_17" href="#fn_3_17">[17]</a>
To determine the exact disposition of these neutral tribes, in particular
the Miamis, Delawares, and Potawatomis, Governor Harrison dispatched
Toussaint Dubois to Fort Wayne. In a council on the 4th of September,
Dubois found the Indians divided almost equally for and against the
Prophet&rsquo;s schemes. After receiving Dubois&rsquo; report, Harrison instructed
John Johnston to separate the friendly Indians from the others and to
place them, if possible, in settlements on the White River, where they
would be safe from the contemplated attack of the American army on
the Prophet&rsquo;s town.</p>
<p>With regular troops and militia, Governor Harrison advanced up the
Wabash in October towards the Prophet&rsquo;s town on the Tippecanoe river.
Early in the morning of November 7, 1811, on the fields of Tippecanoe,
the Prophet&rsquo;s forces attacked Harrison&rsquo;s Army, but were driven back
after a hard fought battle. At Fort Wayne the first reports of the engagement
indicated that the Americans had suffered a severe defeat.
Until the correct information was received a week later, the garrison and
populace were in a state of great anxiety.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the battle, on the 22 of November, the period for
the annual meeting of the Indians to receive their annuities having arrived,
the tribes assembled at Fort Wayne in great numbers. Many of the
chiefs were fresh from Tippecanoe, but they claimed their annuities
along with peaceful tribes, saying that the Prophet alone was to blame
for the hostilities, and that he had been imprisoned by his own followers.
Although entirely untrue, these stories had the desired effect on
John Johnston, and he was thereby induced to grant the Indians their
annuities. Many of the tribes were sincere in seeking peace at this time,
but Johnston&rsquo;s hasty action in granting the annuities provoked Harrison,
who heretofore had never criticized the factor&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
<p>Shortly after this incident, Johnston was transferred to Piqua, Ohio,
to act as principal agent for the Shawnee tribe. His precipitate action in
regard to the annuities had nothing to do with the transfer, since
Johnston himself had applied for the change in positions, five months
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
before the battle of Tippecanoe, in order to be near his farm at Piqua,
Ohio.</p>
<p>Johnston&rsquo;s successor, Major Benjamin Franklin Stickney was a singularly
brave man, but very eccentric and headstrong. A suggestion of
his eccentric character is found in the choice of names for his children.
The sons were styled, &ldquo;One, Two, and Three&rdquo; and the daughters bore
the names of states of the union. Benjamin Stickney had been in the
government service at Upper Sandusky, Ohio, prior to coming to Fort
Wayne. While at Fort Wayne, he and his family occupied the council
house, located just outside the stockade of the fort.</p>
<p>Stickney was rather cold and heartless in his attitude towards the
Indians. In 1815, testifying before a Senate committee, he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it is cheaper to reduce them [Indians] by meat and bread than by
force of arms; and from the observations I have had the opportunity
of making, three or four months full feeding on meat and bread ...
will bring on disease, and in six or eight months great mortality ... I
believe that more Indians might be killed with the expense of
$100,000 in this way than $1,000,000 expended in the support of
armies to go against them.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_18" href="#fn_3_18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December Tecumseh visited Fort Wayne. He had not been a participant
in the battle of Tippecanoe, as the conflict had been instigated
by the Prophet while Tecumseh was visiting the tribes along the Ohio
river. The outcome of the battle had ruined his plan of an Indian confederation,
but Tecumseh was still confident he could succeed with the
help of the British. At Fort Wayne he made bitter reproaches against
Governor Harrison; and at the same time demanded ammunition from
Captain Rhea, who refused. McAfee relates that Tecumseh &ldquo;then said
he would go to his British father, who would not deny him. He appeared
thoughtful a while, and then gave the warwhoop and went
off.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_19" href="#fn_3_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Such was the spirit in which Tecumseh left Fort Wayne. The year
1812 became a period of terror throughout the West. Fort Wayne, in the
center of the turmoil and uncertainty preceding the outbreak of the war,
became an excellent listening-post for the news passing between Malden
and the Indians along the Wabash. Harrison and the officials of the War
Department paid particular attention to the information gathered by
Wells, Stickney and John Shaw at Fort Wayne. On February 10, Wells
reported that two British emissaries passed Fort Wayne on their way to
the Prophet&rsquo;s village. He added that the Potawatomis were ready to
strike the Americans at Fort Dearborn and Fort Wayne whenever war
was declared between the United States and Great Britain.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_20" href="#fn_3_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>On March 1, Wells wrote that Tecumseh had arrived on the Wabash
and that &ldquo;he has determined to raise all the Indians he can, immediately,
with an intention, no doubt, to attack our frontiers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_21" href="#fn_3_21">[21]</a> Writing to
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
General Hull, Benjamin Stickney came to the conclusion, somewhat belatedly,
that it was necessary to cut off all communication between the
Indians within the territory of the United States and Canada.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_22" href="#fn_3_22">[22]</a> Stickney
was also extremely annoyed by the activities of Esidore Chaine, a clever
agitator employed by the British to maintain connections with the Indians
in the Fort Wayne area. Chaine had held several conferences with
the Indians, advising them to remain at peace with the Americans until
war broke out between Great Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The last report of Tecumseh&rsquo;s actions before the outbreak of the
war came from Wells at Fort Wayne. On June 17, Tecumseh stopped
long enough at Fort Wayne for Wells to find out that the chief was on
his way to Malden to receive from the British twelve horse loads of
ammunition for the use of his people at Tippecanoe. The following day,
Congress declared war against Great Britain. A week later the news arrived
at Fort Wayne and the other Northwestern posts.</p>
<p>Even at this hour the question of whether Harrison had full control
over the Indian factor at Fort Wayne or not remained unsettled. This
time Benjamin Stickney, rather than Wells, chose to display his independence
of the Governor. However, the matter did relate to Captain
Wells, who at the time intended to retire altogether from governmental
service at Fort Wayne and move to Kentucky. Having been informed of
this by Colonel Geiger, Wells&rsquo; father-in-law, and believing the presence
of Wells at Fort Wayne was necessary at this critical time, Governor
Harrison wrote to Benjamin Stickney, saying that Stickney should consider
Wells under his immediate orders and that he should employ Wells
wherever possible and beneficial for the government.</p>
<p>To this order Stickney replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all my instructions from the secretary of war ... he has not given
me the least intimation that I was to consider myself under the direction
of any other officer than himself. And as I received my appointment
from the secretary of war by the approbation of the President it
appears to be a dictate of common sense that I should consider his instructions
as the rule of my conduct. And he has instructed me to
have nothing to do with Wells and that Wells is to have nothing to do
with Indian affairs at Fort Wayne. Nevertheless every communication
from you shall be attended to by me with the greatest cheerfullness
and conformed to as far as my instructions with the Department will
permit.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_23" href="#fn_3_23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stickney&rsquo;s attitude provoked Harrison a great deal. The governor
immediately dispatched a lengthy letter to the Secretary of War in which
he brought up the entire question of his authority over the Indian agents
in Indiana Territory, and he urged the War Department to correct any
misconceptions relating to it. Reference was made by Harrison to the
incident of Wells acting independently in 1803 and the vindication of
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Harrison&rsquo;s authority over Wells at that time. Finally, Harrison caustically
observed that &ldquo;it has been reserved for the &lsquo;Common sense&rsquo; of Mr.
Stickney to discover that no such obligation existed because he derived
his appointment immediately from you.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_24" href="#fn_3_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Truly the situation did call for the utmost vigilance from the members
of the Indian department and demanded harmony and concert in
their measures. If Stickney would have been permitted to stand upon
ground independent of the governor, their plans could have resulted in
contradiction that would have produced a discord fatal to the interests of
the nation. Harrison had directed Stickney to correspond regularly with
him concerning the trend of events at Fort Wayne and to send copies of
all such correspondence to the War Department in order that it might be
fully and immediately informed of the important happenings at Fort
Wayne. Harrison had also ordered Wells to send any messages directed
to him through Stickney. However, Wells naturally disregarded these instructions
whenever he wrote to Harrison concerning Stickney&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>Stickney was the subject matter of Wells&rsquo; last two letters to the
Governor. On July 22, Wells reported that the Prophet with one hundred
of his followers had been at Fort Wayne for ten days and planned to
leave that day. During this interval Major Stickney appeared to have
been completely beguiled by the Prophet&rsquo;s declarations of neutrality.
Despite Tippecanoe and the fact that Tecumseh was already allied with
the British, Stickney allowed the Prophet to take the lead in the councils
with Indians and freely gave the Prophet ammunition and supplies. On
July 19, the Prophet received word from Tecumseh to send the women
and children west of the Mississippi and to unite the warriors for a blow
at Vincennes. In order to make better time the Prophet&rsquo;s men stole two
riding horses from Wells&rsquo; farm and proceeded westward. To make sure
that Stickney would suspect nothing, the Prophet informed him of the
theft of the horses and dispatched two men on foot, supposedly to find
the thieves. According to Wells, Stickney swallowed this bait and congratulated
the Prophet on his honesty.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_25" href="#fn_3_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Two weeks before his death at Fort Dearborn, Wells wrote to Harrison,
stating that Stickney, &ldquo;does not consider himself under your constraint.
He declares publicly that you have no authority over him. Your
speech to the Indians has been here seven weeks and has never been
communicated to the Indians by the agent.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_26" href="#fn_3_26">[26]</a> Thus in his last letter,
Wells had completed the circle of contradiction and now stood with Harrison
in an attempt to uphold the governor&rsquo;s authority over the agent at
Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>To his credit, Harrison saw the importance of having Wells remain
at Fort Wayne during this crucial time. Concerning this, Harrison wrote
to the Secretary of War, &ldquo;He [Wells] is ... able from his influence over
a few chiefs of great ability to effect more than any other person particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
with regard to the <i>now</i> all important point of obtaining information.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_27" href="#fn_3_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>Three days after Harrison wrote this, Wells&rsquo; most intimate friend
and greatest of the chiefs, Little Turtle, died at Fort Wayne. The chief
had long suffered from the gout, and in order that he might have the attendance
of the post surgeon, he was brought from his village on the
Eel river to the home of Wells. Little Turtle was buried with full military
honors on Captain Wells&rsquo; farm, Captain Rhea and the officers of
the garrison being present.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_28" href="#fn_3_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Within a period of two weeks after the death of Little Turtle, General
William Hull, governor of Michigan and commandant of a strong
American force at Detroit, sent an order to Fort Dearborn, instructing
the commander Captain Nathan Heald to evacuate the fort and transfer
the occupants of the lonely post to Fort Wayne. Hull also sent word of
the intended evacuation to Fort Wayne, ordering the officers there to
cooperate in the movement by rendering Captain Heald any information
and assistance in their power. Captain Wells, spurred by a desire to aid
in the evacuation and by the fact of his close relationship with Mrs.
Heald, organized a company of thirty friendly Miamis and with Corporal
W. K. Jordan from the garrison started for Fort Dearborn on August
8, 1812. Milo Quaife asserts that the arrival of Wells five days
later afforded the only ray of cheer and hope which came to the settlement
in this time of danger.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_29" href="#fn_3_29">[29]</a> Preparations for departure were under
way when Wells arrived. Wells was downcast. To remain in the fort
now meant death from starvation as all the supplies except the little
needed for the journey had been destroyed or given to the Indians. The
attempt to reach Fort Wayne was the only alternative.</p>
<p>The story of the anguished departure from the fort on the morning
of August 15 and the subsequent massacre need not be related here.
Suffice it to say that Captain Wells was killed during the battle in an attempt
to save the women and children. The Indians paid their sincerest
tribute of respect to his bravery by cutting out his heart and eating it,
thinking thus to imbibe the qualities of its owner in life. Quaife writes,
&ldquo;Wells was the real hero of the Chicago masacre, giving his life voluntarily
to save his friends.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_30" href="#fn_3_30">[30]</a> Thus, Captain Wells&rsquo; colorful career was
brought to a close. Paradoxically, he died while fighting against the Indians,
although in his first battles he had fought on their side. In death
as in life Wells remained an enigmatic figure, one who deserves far
more attention by those endeavoring to understand the frontier with its
curious mixture of romanticism and realism. Wells&rsquo; companion from
Fort Wayne, Corporal Jordan, was captured by the Indians but later
made his escape, finally reaching the safety of Fort Wayne on August
26 after seven days in the wilderness.</p>

<br />The Siege of Fort Wayne</h2>
<p>At last the savages had struck their long deferred blow. The little
garrison of eighty-five men at Fort Wayne received with alarm the first
account of the massacre at Fort Dearborn. The news was conveyed by
one of the friendly Miamis who had accompanied Wells to Fort Dearborn.
Unknown to the garrison at this date was the fact that Detroit&mdash;the
protecting center of the other northwestern posts&mdash;had been ingloriously
surrendered on August 16 to a British-Indian force by General
William Hull. Mackinac had already fallen to the British. Tecumseh and
the British now turned their attention to the reduction of Fort Wayne and
Fort Harrison (near Terre Haute, Indiana), as the principal remaining obstacles
to prevent them from driving the white inhabitants beyond the
Ohio river. After their success at Dearborn, a council was held by the
Indian tribes and British officers at the Potawatomie villages. Here it
was determined that the Potawatomies together with the Ottawas were to
be assisted in the proposed siege of Fort Wayne by a British force under
Major Muir. Meanwhile the Winnebagoes and Miamis would direct their
attention toward Fort Harrison.</p>
<p>When the people of Fort Wayne became aware of the gravity of
their situation, it was determined to send the women and children to a
safe refuge, the closest being Piqua, Ohio. In order to accomplish this,
Captain John Logan, a Shawnee Indian, was sent by John Johnston from
Piqua to conduct the group which numbered close to twenty-five.
Among Logan&rsquo;s charges on the hundred-mile journey were Ann, Rebecca,
and Mary Wells, and the wives and children of Antoine Bondie,
William Bailey, and Stephen Johnston. This was but the first of many
acts of heroism on the part of the Shawnee brave, John Logan, during
the war.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_1" href="#fn_4_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>None too soon were the women and children removed to a place of
safety, for in a short time about five hundred warriors began to gather
quietly about Fort Wayne, encamping in the forest and seeking to avoid
open evidence of hostility. Theirs was a waiting game, as the British
had promised troops and artillery within a period of twenty days.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the garrison and the people remaining near Fort
Wayne, the Indian plan to attack the fort was discovered beforehand in
much the same manner as Pontiac&rsquo;s famous plan to capture Detroit had
been revealed to the British at an earlier date in history. On the night of
August 20, Metea, a Potawatomie chief, made his way under cover of
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
darkness to the cabin of Antoine Bondie outside of the fort enclosure
and there revealed to Bondie the plans of attack in order that Bondie
and his Indian wife might escape death. Antoine Bondie, a French
trader, was then about fifty years old and had lived with the Indians
since he was twelve near the vicinity of Fort Wayne. Metea naturally
thought that Bondie would join them and when the Frenchman did not
decline the chief&rsquo;s offer, he suspected nothing.</p>
<p>However, Bondie accompanied by Charles Peltier, another French
trader, went to Benjamin Stickney the following morning and informed
the agent of the plot.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_2" href="#fn_4_2">[2]</a> Stickney, who at a later date wrote his account of
the siege, gave himself most of the credit for the turn the events then
took.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_3" href="#fn_4_3">[3]</a> At first, he relates, he was inclined to reject Bondie&rsquo;s information
as false, since a mistake in a matter of so much importance would have
proved ruinous to his character and would have resulted in his disgraceful
ejection from office. However, he informed Captain Rhea of the
situation, and despite the fact that the Captain discredited Bondie&rsquo;s story
on the grounds that the latter was untrustworthy, Stickney determined to
send an express to Harrison at Cincinnati and another to Captain Taylor
at Terre Haute informing them of the state of affairs.</p>
<p>Why Captain Rhea should have refused and Stickney should have
hesitated to believe that an attack was imminent even though they knew
of the massacre at Fort Dearborn is difficult to understand. It can be
said in their defense that when Bondie revealed to them the plot of the
red men, they had not yet heard of the surrender of Detroit; consequently,
did not realize their position was so precarious. Lt. Curtis in
his account of the siege of Fort Wayne states that many attempts were
made to send messages through to Detroit, but that they all failed.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_4" href="#fn_4_4">[4]</a> Earlier
in the same day that Metea informed Bondie of the coming attack
on Fort Wayne, Captain Rhea expressed the rather naive belief that the
Potawatomies gathering about the fort intended to proceed to Piqua for a
conference with the U. S. commissioners, and requested Governor
Meigs of Ohio to send him instructions concerning the matter. At the
same time Captain Rhea asked for information in regard to General
Hull&rsquo;s movements at Detroit, which indicated he knew nothing of the
surrender.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_5" href="#fn_4_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Four days later it was becoming increasingly apparent that the information
furnished by Antoine Bondie was no mere fiction. Stephen
Johnston, who served as a clerk at the Fort Wayne factory after the departure
of his older brother, described conditions surrounding the fort in
a letter written August 24, 1812, to his wife at Piqua:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have about four hundred Indians here. Their intentions are very
suspicious. I have moved all the public goods into the garrison, so
that I am now unincumbered by the business, and if it were not for
Mr. Stickney&rsquo;s illness, and having to attend to his department, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
would leave the place for the present, as the trading establishment is
at an end for the time being.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_6" href="#fn_4_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 24 or 25 of August, Captain Rhea dispatched a message to
General Worthington and Governor Meigs of Ohio, stating that he expected
the fort to be attacked that night.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_7" href="#fn_4_7">[7]</a> This was the last communication
received from the garrison prior to the start of the siege. It is fortunate
that these appeals for aid were sent by Benjamin Stickney and Captain
Rhea as they served to hasten Harrison&rsquo;s army of relief in time to
save the fort. By August 28, Harrison, realizing the gravity of the situation,
wrote to the Secretary of War, &ldquo;The relief of Fort Wayne will be
my first object.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_8" href="#fn_4_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile at Fort Wayne, both parties wished to delay the final
conflict, the garrison in order to give time to Harrison to bring the
necessary relief, and the Indians, from daily expectation of the arrival of
the British force which had been promised them. Within the fort, the
situation was rendered highly embarrassing and hazardous by the condition
of Captain Rhea who began to drink heavily and was incapable of
handling any duties. It is evident also that ill-feeling between Benjamin
Stickney and the two lieutenants, Curtis and Ostrander, was not lacking.
In his account, Stickney wrote, &ldquo;The commanding officer was drunk
nearly all the time, and the two lieutenants were inefficient men, entirely
unfit to hold commissions of any grade.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_9" href="#fn_4_9">[9]</a> This last statement
must be taken with some allowance, as Philip Ostrander was later made
temporary commander of Fort Wayne with Harrison&rsquo;s approval, and
Daniel Curtis rose to the rank of captain after creditable service during
the war.</p>
<p>By August 28, the post was definitely in a state of siege. About ten
o&rsquo;clock that night Stephen Johnston, accompanied by Peter Oliver and a
recently discharged soldier set out for Piqua, as Johnston was eager to
join his wife there. When the three men had arrived at a point a short
distance south of the fort, near what was the Hanna homestead, they
were fired upon by the Indians. Johnston was killed instantly. The other
two men fled back to the fort. A reward of twenty dollars, offered by
Antoine Bondie the next day for the return of Johnston&rsquo;s body to the
fort&mdash;a work performed by a young chief, White Racoon&mdash;revealed the
fact that Johnston had been scalped and tomahawked in a most brutal
manner.</p>
<p>No further proof of the attitude of the Indians was needed; however
the next morning an Indian approached the fort and asked Stickney for a
white flag in order that some of the chiefs might come and speak with
him. The flag was granted under a promise of its being returned that
day, but the Indians kept it several days during which time they were
constantly plundering the gardens and cornfields and were killing and
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
carrying away the cattle and hogs. This they did right under the guns of
the fort, and comments Lt. Curtis, &ldquo;we poor soldiers, either from cowardice
or some other agency in our captain, were not suffered to fire a
gun but obliged their repeated insults to pass with impunity.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_10" href="#fn_4_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On one occasion a party of soldiers left the fort to check the Indians.
For this the lieutenants were rebuked by Captain Rhea in an official
order.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_11" href="#fn_4_11">[11]</a> Finally the Indians bearing the flag before themselves approached
the fort in large number, hoping evidently to be allowed to
enter in such force as to be able to overpower the occupants. But only a
few were admitted by Stickney, who designated thirteen chiefs who
would be welcomed. Each chief was disarmed on entering the stockade
and the party followed the agent to his quarters. At the request of
Stickney the troops were paraded during the council which followed.
When the council pipes were finished, Winamac addressing the agent
disclaimed any part in the death of Johnston. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if my
father wishes for war, I am a man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_12" href="#fn_4_12">[12]</a> With this expression he struck
his hand upon a knife that was concealed under his blanket. Stickney at
the time did not understand the language, but Antoine Bondie who was
present and understood the whole force of what was said, sprang to his
feet and, striking his own knife, shouted in Potawatomie, &ldquo;I, too, am a
man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_13" href="#fn_4_13">[13]</a> His dramatic action, together with the appearance of the soldiers,
fully armed, brought the plot to a finish. The Indians had hoped
through the murder of Stickney and the officers, to be able to control
the situation within the fort, even to the opening of the gates to allow
the entrance of their warriors. However, they filed back to their encampment
disappointed.</p>
<p>The garrison was cheered on September 1 by the arrival of William
Oliver who brought news of the approach of Harrison&rsquo;s army. Oliver,
who was then twenty-five years of age, had been connected with the
fort as a sutler. While the Indians were gathering about the fort he was
absent in Cincinnati purchasing supplies, and there he learned of the
state of affairs at Fort Wayne. He enlisted with the Ohio troops and offered
his services to General Harrison with the proposition that the general
allow him to proceed from St. Mary&rsquo;s, Ohio, to Fort Wayne with a
small company as an advance detachment of the army of relief. This he
did, but when the group of ninety-four men came within twenty-four
miles of Fort Wayne, they ascertained the size of the besieging forces to
be larger than they could safely meet in an open encounter. Oliver continued
on, however, with three Shawnees&mdash;Captain John Logan, Captain
Johnny, and Brighthorn. Well mounted and well armed, they eluded
the vigilance of the besiegers and succeeded in reaching the Maumee
river at a point one and a half miles east of the fort. Here they left their
horses in order to make a preliminary reconnoiter. The enemy was conferring
on a strategem for the capture of the garrison and had gathered
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
on the west and south sides of the fort. Returning to their horses, the
four messengers rode stealthily along the Maumee and up the bank to
the east wall of the fort. No member of the garrison was in sight. In despair,
they rode down the river bank and skirted the shore as they turned
their horses to the west to follow the St. Mary&rsquo;s river. Then, in full
view of the Indians, they dashed up the river bank and made straight for
the north gate of the fort, at a moment when Winamac and four other
chiefs were rounding the northwest corner of the fort with a flag of truce
to hold another conference with the commandant. The sudden appearance
of the riders disconcerted the besiegers who believed them to be
the advance of a large relieving force. Winamac retired after a mere
handshake. Lt. Curtis later stated, &ldquo;The safe arrival of Mr. Oliver at
that particular juncture may justly be considered most miraculous. One
hour sooner or one hour later would no doubt have been inevitable destruction
both to himself and escort.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_14" href="#fn_4_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Once within the fort Oliver announced the approach of Harrison&rsquo;s
army and immediately dispatched a note to Harrison by John Logan and
his companions, who succeeded in evading the besiegers once again.</p>
<p>In the meantime Harrison&rsquo;s force had reached Piqua on September
1. Here he found the whole &ldquo;country in dreadful alarm on account of
the fall of Detroit and Chicago and the supposed investiture of Fort
Wayne by the Indians.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_15" href="#fn_4_15">[15]</a> A body of 700 volunteers for the relief of
Fort Wayne was unwilling to go beyond Shane&rsquo;s Crossing on the St.
Mary&rsquo;s without reinforcements. On September 4, Harrison received information
that a British and Indian force was advancing toward Fort
Wayne from Malden. Actually, the British detachment under Major
Muir did not leave Malden until September 16, four days after the siege
was abandoned by the Indians. This delay by the British was occasioned
by the temporary armistice arranged between General George Prevost
and General Dearborn. Had the British sent support to the besieging Indians
sooner, or had not Harrison been so prompt in bringing relief, the
outcome of the siege of Fort Wayne might have been far different. As it
was the garrison being well supplied with provisions was able to withstand
the attacks made by the Indians.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Wayne was fairly critical from
September 3, to September 12. On September 3, Captain Rhea published
his final garrison order, saying, &ldquo;It is earnestly hoped by the
Commanding Officer that for this night every man will be at his
post,&mdash;relief is at hand but means may be taken to cut us off from that
relief. Should any man be found inattentive to his duty, punishment ensues;
For on this night, our fame, our honor and every thing that is near
&amp; dear depends. &mdash;be therefore Cautious and brave&mdash;&ldquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_16" href="#fn_4_16">[16]</a> For the
following twenty-seven days no entry was placed in the Orderly Book.
The next morning, despite his dramatic order, Captain Rhea, inwardly
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
disheartened and apprehensive of the doom of the garrison and its occupants,
took to drink to bolster his despairing nature.</p>
<p>On the same day the chiefs again approached the fort with a flag of
truce, and being asked whether they wished war or peace, Winemac replied,
&ldquo;You know that Mackinaw is taken, Detroit is in the hands of the
British, and Chicago has fallen; and you must expect to fall next, and
that in a short time! Immediately&rdquo;, Lt. Curtis continues, &ldquo;our great captain
invited the savage over to his headquarters and after drinking three
glasses of wine with him rose from his seat and observed: &lsquo;My good
friend, I love you; I will fight for you; I will die by your side. You must
save me!&rsquo; and then gave him a half dollar as a token of friendship, inviting
him at the same time to come and breakfast with him the next
morning.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_17" href="#fn_4_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Winamac failed to accept the Captain&rsquo;s invitation to breakfast, but
instead sent five warriors who secreted themselves behind a small building
and shot two members of the garrison. From then on the siege became
active. That night the Indians made a general attack, but were driven
off by the four howitzers of the fort. Almost continuous firing was
kept up day and night until September 10; several times the buildings
were set on fire by flaming arrows, but the vigilance of the garrison
prevented a conflagration.</p>
<p>During this time, Captain Rhea continued &ldquo;drunk as a fool, and
perfectly incapable of exercising rationality on any subject whatsoever,
but was constantly abusing and illtreating everyone that came in his presence.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_18" href="#fn_4_18">[18]</a>
The disorder and confusion he created among the men was
one of the greatest dangers of the siege. At one time Lieutenants Curtis
and Ostrander considered placing him under arrest in order to silence his
clamor. The captain would frequently talk of surrendering if the Indian
attacks grew stronger and particularly if they or the British would bring
up the cannon they had captured at Chicago. When Captain Rhea was
told by Lt. Ostrander that the largest piece at Chicago was a three-pounder
and that the first person in the garrison who should offer to surrender
at the approach of no heavier piece than a three-pounder should
instantly be shot, he remained silent on the subject.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, instead of waiting at Piqua for the arrival of General
James Winchester, who had been assigned to the command of the
northwestern army, Harrison issued the following call:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mounted Volunteers! I requested you, in my late address to rendezvous
at Dayton on the 15th instant. I have now a more pressing call
for your services! The British and Indians have invaded our country
and are now besieging (perhaps have taken) Fort Wayne. Every friend
to his country, who is able to do so, will join me as soon as possible,
well mounted, with a good rifle and twenty or thirty days provisions.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_19" href="#fn_4_19">[19]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Although Harrison was eager to press forward, the army was detained
at Piqua for lack of flints and did not move until September 6.
Two days later it reached Girty&rsquo;s Town, now St. Mary&rsquo;s, Ohio. By that
time the army numbered 2,200 men, and the scouts sent out by the Indians
returned to their camp with the report that &ldquo;Kentuck is coming as
numerous as the trees.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_20" href="#fn_4_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>At Fort Wayne comparative calm had set in, according to Lt. Curtis&rsquo;
account. &ldquo;After the 10th we rested in tranquility, but could see
large bodies of Indians between that time and the 12th running in great
haste across the prairies and many without arms.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_21" href="#fn_4_21">[21]</a> On the night of the
11th, while still seventeen miles from Fort Wayne, Harrison wrote to the
Secretary of War that he fully expected a major engagement the following
day. The Indians were prepared to give battle at a swamp five
miles southeast of the fort, but finding Harrison&rsquo;s army too strong to attack,
they kindled extensive fires to create the impression within the fort
that a battle had occurred. They hoped thereby to draw the troops out of
the fort, but his final ruse failed, and the Indians withdrew, some only a
few minutes before the arrival of Harrison&rsquo;s advance guard.</p>
<p>The arrival of the army around three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon was an
occasion of great joy to the troops and people who had taken refuge
within the fort. Harrison&rsquo;s men encamped outside the walls of the fort
where, McAfee relates, &ldquo;a few days previous there had been a handsome
little village; but it was now in ruins.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_22" href="#fn_4_22">[22]</a> The government factory
had been burned by the Indians as well as the large council house. Captain
Wells&rsquo; farm had been overrun and laid waste, while all the outlying
homes were destroyed. The corn which had been cultivated by the villagers
was nearly all gone and the remainder served as forage for Harrison&rsquo;s
cavalry.</p>
<p>Fort Wayne was described by McAfee as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delightfully situated on an eminence on the south bank of the Miami
of the Lake [Maumee river] immediately below the formation that
river by the junction of the St. Marys with the St. Josephs ... It is
well constructed of block houses and picketting, but could not resist a
British force, as there are several eminences on the south side, from
which it could be commanded by a six or nine pounder.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_23" href="#fn_4_23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After referring to the proximity of the Wabash river to that of the
St. Mary&rsquo;s, McAfee added, &ldquo;A canal at some future day will unite
these rivers and thus render a town at Fort Wayne, as formerly, the most
considerable place in all that country.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_24" href="#fn_4_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>From a military viewpoint, Fort Wayne had successfully withstood
the siege, but the destruction of the village and trade must be considered
as a major setback to the community. McAfee indicated this even
though he foresaw a more promising future. As late as 1821, Thomas
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Teas wrote after visiting Fort Wayne, &ldquo;The village before the late war
was much larger than at present.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_25" href="#fn_4_25">[25]</a> Many of the families who left Fort
Wayne in 1812 never returned.</p>
<p>On the day following Harrison&rsquo;s arrival, detachments, using Fort
Wayne as their base of operations, commenced the destruction of the
Indian villages of the entire region. The men who remained at Fort
Wayne proceeded to remove all the underbrush surrounding the fort.
The land was cleared on both sides of each river for a mile in every direction.</p>
<p>After arranging his camp, Harrison summoned the officers and
agent of the fort and there, from Lieutenants Curtis and Ostrander, with
Benjamin Stickney as a corroborative witness, heard the charges preferred
against Captain Rhea. Rhea was placed under arrest and after a
careful consideration of the charges, Harrison was in favor of having
him brought before a court martial. However, on account of his age and
his having a young family, Rhea was allowed to resign. He was given
until December 20 to return home, at which time his pay and emoluments
ceased.</p>
<p>On September 18, General James Winchester arrived at Fort Wayne
to take command of the army. It was only after the troops had been
promised that Harrison would soon be re-appointed commander that they
consented to march toward Detroit under Winchester.</p>
<p>General Winchester chose to follow the usual route to Detroit by
moving down the north bank of the Maumee. The American army left
Fort Wayne on September 22. Meanwhile unaware that the siege of Fort
Wayne had been lifted, the British commander at Detroit, Colonel Proctor,
dispatched two hundred British regulars under Major Muir together
with a thousand Indians under Captain Elliot to assist in taking Fort
Wayne. Having brought their baggage and artillery up the Maumee as
far as Fort Defiance, the British discovered the approach of Winchester&rsquo;s
stronger army. A hasty retreat on the part of the British followed.
Their cannon and heavy equipment were thrown into the river.</p>
<p>As pointed out previously the British had delayed sending this expedition
because of the temporary armistice. Had the force under Major
Muir reached Fort Wayne before Harrison&rsquo;s army, it is likely that the
fort would have fallen, which would have rendered the recapture of Detroit
much more difficult. General Brock in writing to his superior, Sir
George Prevost, expressed the belief that Fort Wayne would surely fall
to Major Muir and added, &ldquo;The Indians were likewise looking to us for
assistance. They heard of the Armistice with every mark of jealousy,
and had we refused joining them in the expedition it is impossible to
calculate the consequences.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_26" href="#fn_4_26">[26]</a> That the British troops were prepared to
batter down the palisades of Fort Wayne is shown by the official report
of Major Muir to Colonel Proctor. Some of his officers endeavored to
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
induce Major Muir to hold his position at Defiance and use their cannon
to prevent the advance of Winchester&rsquo;s troops. &ldquo;I told them&rdquo;, Major
Muir wrote, &ldquo;that the guns were brought for the purposes of battering
Fort Wayne, but would not answer to fight in the woods.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_27" href="#fn_4_27">[27]</a> Colonel
Proctor, in turn explaining the movement to General Brock, wrote,
&ldquo;The delay occasioned by the armistice prevented the attainment of the
object of our expedition, which was destruction of Fort Wayne.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_28" href="#fn_4_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>After the departure of Captain Rhea, Lt. Philip Ostrander was left
in temporary charge of Fort Wayne for a period of nine weeks. During
October, Ostrander reported that over half the garrison was sick. For
these men there was no medicine, while all the men were destitute of
clothing and blankets. Concerning the Indian menace, the situation had
improved, but the danger from attack had not passed. Lt. Ostrander issued
a stern warning to his men not to leave the fort without permission.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_29" href="#fn_4_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>Word that the Indians were again collecting around Fort Wayne induced
Harrison to send Colonel Allen Trimble and five hundred
mounted volunteers to the fort. A battalion of Ohio infantry was also
sent to Fort Wayne with much needed provisions. While at Fort Wayne
this group collected firewood since the garrison was unable to do so
with the hostile Indians lurking in the woods.</p>
<p>On November 22, 1812, Captain Hugh Moore arrived at Fort
Wayne to take command of the post. Little is known about Captain
Moore. He had been with Harrison from the outbreak of the war. At
Fort Wayne he served as commander until the summer of 1813 when he
was succeeded by Major Joseph Jenkinson. Captain Moore&rsquo;s first order
was the appointment of Antoine Bondie as issuing agent at the post.
This was obviously in recognition of Bondie&rsquo;s service during the siege.
This position enabled Bondie to support his family, as his trading establishment
was all but ruined. Later Bondie was also appointed captain of
the scouts which were sent out occasionally from the fort.</p>
<p>On April 28, 1813, Captain Moore issued an order placing Lt.
Philip Ostrander under arrest and prohibiting any member of the garrison
from communicating with the younger officer. Lt. Ostrander was
never brought before a military court, but died on July 13, 1813, while
still imprisoned. There is no reason given for the arrest in the orderly
book, other than the statement, &ldquo;circumstances have transpired within
this garrison of a most destructive, injurious and dangerous nature to the
service.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_30" href="#fn_4_30">[30]</a> Brice in his short history of Fort Wayne says: &ldquo;Lieutenant Ostrander ... who
had unthoughtfully fired upon a flock of birds passing
over the fort, had been reprimanded by Captain Ray [Rhea], and because
of his refusal to be tried by courtmartial, was confined in a small
room in the garrison, where he subsequently died.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_31" href="#fn_4_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>This account is rendered impossible from the fact that Ostrander
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
acted as commandant from the time of Rhea&rsquo;s departure in disgrace,
until the arrival of Captain Moore. As late as January 5, 1813, Lt. Ostrander
was a member of a court martial, which found Alexander Scott
guilty of contemptuous conduct to one of the officers, possibly Ostrander
himself. After that date his name does not appear in the record until
April 27, 1813, the day prior to his arrest, when the same Alexander
Scott was tried and acquitted on a charge of traducing Lt. Ostrander&rsquo;s
character.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_32" href="#fn_4_32">[32]</a> In what manner Scott supposedly slandered Lt. Ostrander is
not stated in the proceedings of the trial; however, it is possible to surmise
that there was some connection between the charge and Lt. Ostrander&rsquo;s
arrest the following day.</p>
<p>During the year 1813, Fort Wayne became the natural center for
supplies used by the American armies operating in northern Ohio and
eastern Michigan. In May of that year, Harrison addressed the Secretary
of War, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am persuaded that a demonstration in the direction of Fort Wayne
by a body of mounted men would be attended by very happy effects.
I am not entirely at ease on the subject of the garrisons in that direction.
The enemy, if they understood their business will certainly
make an attempt to carry some of our weak posts where we have
large deposits ... I have always been partial to the assembling a
body of Troops in the Vicinity of Fort Wayne. It is in the immediate
line of communication between the Indians of the Wabash, Illinois,
Mississippi, and the South and West sides of Lake Michigan and
Malden.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_33" href="#fn_4_33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this logic, Harrison ordered Colonel Richard M. Johnson
to proceed to Fort Wayne and from thence to scour the northwestern
frontiers. After a difficult journey over the swollen St. Mary&rsquo;s river and
flooded countryside, Johnson&rsquo;s men reached Fort Wayne on June 7.
Grim excitement greeted their arrival. One of the ten flatboats bringing
provisions to Fort Wayne had struck on a bar within sight of the fort.
Before help could arrive, the three crewmen were killed by Indians lurking
near the fort. Johnson&rsquo;s cavalry pursued the red men, but nightfall
and rain ended their endeavor.</p>
<p>Leaving their heavy baggage at Fort Wayne, the regiment moved
across the St. Mary&rsquo;s and established their camp in the present Spy Run
district of Fort Wayne. After a day&rsquo;s rest, Johnson&rsquo;s men began a march
two hundred miles in the region to the northwest of Fort Wayne. They
returned to the fort on June 14. The result of this excursion was important,
for never before had this land been traversed by such a large body
of white men. The knowledge gained at this time, together with the information
published by Capt. McAfee, played a significant part in the
development of the northwestern part of Indiana.</p>
<p>After spending a few days at Fort Wayne, Johnson&rsquo;s regiment proceeded
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
down the Maumee to join Harrison&rsquo;s army, and aid in the recapture
of Detroit. On October 5, 1813, the British and Indian forces were
routed at the battle of the Thames by the American army under Harrison.
Tecumseh was killed in the battle, and in effect, the Indian power
was broken forever in the old Northwest. This battle, following closely
upon Perry&rsquo;s victory on Lake Erie, brought the war to an unofficial
close in this region.</p>
<p>The danger of Indian hostilities at Fort Wayne was never again critical,
but the safety of the people about the fort was still menaced by occasional
attacks. Such a one occurred late in 1813, when Major Joseph
Jenkinson arrived to succeed Captain Hugh Moore as commander of
Fort Wayne. On the march from Newport, Kentucky, three companies
of militia which accompanied Major Jenkinson found it convenient, in
the latter part of their journey, to convey their supplies by flatboats on
the St. Mary&rsquo;s river. At a sharp bend in the stream about a mile from
the fort, the Indians ambushed the last of the boats and killed the men
who were guiding it.</p>
<p>Major Jenkinson&rsquo;s period of service at Fort Wayne was brief. His
family did not accompany him to the post, and after six months he
chose to return to Kentucky where he was appointed adjutant of the
state militia. The only existent letter of Major Jenkinson while he was
stationed at Fort Wayne, throws some light on the attitude of the local
French people toward slavery. The major, writing to his wife, complained
that some of the French men living near Fort Wayne had
thoroughly &ldquo;corrupted Ephraim [the major&rsquo;s slave] by their ideas&rdquo;; so
much so that it was necessary &ldquo;to cool the fellow off, by two very hard
whippings.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_34" href="#fn_4_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>In May, 1814, the command of Fort Wayne was given to Major
John Whistler of the First United States Infantry. Major Whistler was
not a stranger to Fort Wayne. As a lieutenant he had accompanied
Wayne on his western campaign, and was here to assist in the building
of the original fort. He remained as a special officer to oversee the
maintenance of the forts of the surrounding region. Later, his wife joined
him at Fort Wayne, and it was here that their son, George Washington
Whistler was born in 1800.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_35" href="#fn_4_35">[35]</a> Following Major John Whistler&rsquo;s early
service at Fort Wayne, he was transferred to Detroit, and from thence to
Chicago, where he built Fort Dearborn and became its first commandant.</p>
<p>Major Whistler was chronically in debt. In fact, his financial outlook
was almost hopeless. With a salary, as a captain, of $40.00 a
month, he had a family of fifteen children to maintain. To make matters
worse, the visits of the government paymaster were highly irregular. On
one occasion, he wrote to a creditor that he had received no pay in a
period of more than two years. &ldquo;I hope you will not think I complain
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
against my government for detaining my pay,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;No, but
necessity forces me to make the real statement to satisfy my creditor.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_36" href="#fn_4_36">[36]</a>
It is distinctly to Major Whistler&rsquo;s credit that even in the act of pressing
for payment his creditors frequently paused to express confidence in his
honesty and sympathy for his lot.</p>
<p>The year 1814, which marked the return of the Whistler family also
marks the re-establishment of family life in and about Fort Wayne.
While the Maloch and Peltier families remained at Fort Wayne throughout
the war, the other Fort Wayne families had taken refuge mainly in
the more settled areas along the Ohio river. Some of the families never
did return, but among those who did was the Louis Bourie family.
Bourie as early as 1786 maintained a profitable enterprise at the portage
by keeping pack-horses and a warehouse for the deposit and transportation
of merchandise and peltries. During the war, he moved to Detroit
with his wife and two children. Soon after his return to Fort Wayne in
1814, Bourie was given a contract to provide bread for the soldiers, and
in 1815, he built a bakery at the corner of the present Clinton and Columbia
streets. A short time later he established a general store and
erected a log residence adjoining the building.</p>
<p>George Hunt, who had served as a sutler prior to the war, also returned
to Fort Wayne in 1814. He was the son of Colonel Thomas Hunt,
the third commander at Fort Wayne. With George Hunt came his
younger brother, John Elliott Hunt.</p>
<p>Lt. Daniel Curtis, to whom we are indebted for the best account of
the siege, was still connected with the post in 1814. Other residents of
the fort in that year included Benjamin Stickney, who remained as Indian
agent; Benjamin Berry Kercheval and Peter Oliver, clerks of the
agent; Charles Peltier a fur trader; John P. Hedges, who had first visited
the fort in 1812 and who was now stationed at the fort as a storekeeper;
Dr. Daniel Smith, the post surgeon; Robert Forsythe, who later became
a paymaster in the United States army; and a French blacksmith,
Louisaneau, who had a government appointment to do work for the
troops as well as the Indians about the fort.</p>
<p>One of the new arrivals at Fort Wayne at this time was William
Suttenfield. Suttenfield had first visited Fort Wayne in 1811, at which
time he was in Colonel John Johnston&rsquo;s employ, being in charge of a
pack train hauling military and Indian stores from Piqua, Ohio, to the
fort. In 1814, he brought his wife, formerly Laura Taylor, and his infant
son, William F. Suttenfield, to Fort Wayne by way of the St. Mary&rsquo;s
river, the route used most frequently by travelers from southwestern
Ohio. Suttenfield was for many months after his arrival employed in
bringing provisions to the fort from Piqua and other points. He was short,
slender, and very active and agile. For these reasons he boasted that the
Indians could not catch him while he was bringing in supplies. Soon
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
after their arrival, the Suttenfields built a log house outside the fort.
This was the first home erected beyond the protecting walls of the fort,
following the siege. It stood near the river to the south of the fort.</p>
<p>Mrs. Laura Suttenfield lived until 1886. Before her death, she left
an impressive description of a 4th of July celebration in 1814. The isolation
and quietude of Fort Wayne in that year is suggested by her account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fort at that time contained sixty men of the regular army, all patriotic
and anxious to celebrate one day in the year. They made three
green bowers, 100 feet from the pickets of the fort ... one bower for
the dinner table, one for the cooks and one for the music. Major
Whistler had two German cooks and they prepared the dinner.... Our
dinner consisted of one fine turkey, a side of venison, boiled ham,
vegetables in abundance, cranberries and green currents. As for dessert,
we had none. Eggs were not known here for three years from
that time. There were but three bottles of wine sent here from Cincinnati;
but one was made use of. Then there were a few toasts, and,
after three guns and music, they went into the fort and the ladies
changed their dresses. Then Major Whistler called for the music,
which consisted of one bass drum, two small ones, one fife, violin
and flute. There was a long gallery in the fort; the musicians took
their seats there.... A french four passed off very well for an hour.
Then the gates of the fort were closed at sundown, which gave it a
gloomy appearance. No children, no younger persons for amusement,
all retired to their rooms. All was quiet and still. The sentinel on his
lonely round would give us the hour of the night. In the morning we
were aroused by the beating of the reveille.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_37" href="#fn_4_37">[37]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lives of these residents of Fort Wayne in 1814 were never
without some fear of possible attack from the Indians, even though the
danger had diminished. That Major Whistler expected just such an attack
is evident by his letter of July 1 to Brigadier General Duncan
McArthur, in which he asked for additional men or permission to reconstruct
the fort. Said he &ldquo;The Indians show a bad disposition to attend
the Treaty [This treaty was held at Greenville]. I have Received an Account
from Mr. Johnston that the Potawatomies and Taways and the
Other Indians Bordering on Lake Michigan are intending to join the
British and take Detroit, Malden and this Place this Moon.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_38" href="#fn_4_38">[38]</a></p>
<p>The conduct of Chief Richardville had been especially annoying to
Major Whistler. At the outbreak of the war, Richardville hurriedly
gathered his effects and fled with his family to the British lines and
there remained, without taking an active part in the trouble, until 1814.
When he returned to his home six miles east of Fort Wayne, Major
Whistler invited him to a conference. He responded, but he appeared reluctant
to attend the conference at Greenville. Finally he came, in company
with Chief Chondonnai, a participant in the Fort Dearborn massacre,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
and placed his signature to the treaty.</p>
<p>In May, 1815, Major Whistler again informed General McArthur of his
intention to rebuild the fort, provided he could receive permission from the
War Department. Permission was granted and in the fall of 1815, Major
Whistler directed the construction of the new fort to take the place of the one
erected by the troops of Colonel Hunt fifteen years before. Thus it fell to the
lot of the builder of the first Fort Dearborn to become in turn the builder of the
last Fort Wayne. Although the troops were destined to remain in this fort only
four more years, parts of it remained standing until 1852, and for a long time
after the garrison evacuated it, the fort served the government agencies and
some of the citizens as a useful shelter.</p>
<p>The best source of information in regard to this last fort is in the record
of John W. Dawson, who, in 1858, gathered information from the early
settlers and wrote a series of articles for the local paper.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_39" href="#fn_4_39">[39]</a> According to
Dawson, the fort enclosed an area about 150 feet square. The pickets were
ten feet high, and set in the ground, with block houses at the southeast and
northwest corners, which were two stories high. The second floor projected
and formed a bastion in each blockhouse where the guns were rigged; that on
the southeast corner commanding the south and east sides of the fort, and that
on the northwest corner, the north and west sides. The officers&rsquo; quarters,
commissary department and other buildings located on different sides
formed part of the walls, and in the center stood the liberty pole from which
the flag flew.</p>
<p>The plaza, in the enclosure was smooth and gravelly. The roofs of the
houses all declined within the stockade after the shed fashion, to prevent the
enemy from setting them on fire, and if fired, to protect the men in putting it
out. The rainwater was carried along by wooden troughs, just below the
surface of the ground to the flagstaff, and from thence led by a sluiceway to
the Maumee.</p>
<p>Dawson believed that when Major Whistler rebuilt the fort, he did not
include all of the ground covered by the fort built under Colonel Hunt&rsquo;s
direction. This conviction is substantiated by the fact that before building the
new fort, Whistler expressed the opinion that the old fort was too large for
the number of troops he had to defend it.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_40" href="#fn_4_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>Writing to General McArthur on October 17, 1815, Major Whistler
reported that the new fort was almost completed. Only one section of the old
fort needed to be taken down and replaced by the new. Whistler expressed
the belief that the new fort was the most substantial in the West. &ldquo;The
pickets&rdquo;, he wrote, &ldquo;were 12&frac12; feet long and were put in sets of six, with a
cross-piece two feet from the top, set in and spiked, and a trench dug 2&frac12; feet
deep, into which they were raised.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_41" href="#fn_4_41">[41]</a> The major added that he was anxious
to complete the work as he expected difficulties with the Indians, who
declared their intention to continue the war against the United States.
Benjamin Stickney, also writing from Fort Wayne, expressed the same
belief.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_42" href="#fn_4_42">[42]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>However, the threatened outbreak of the Indians did not materialize.
British intrigue had come to an end, and the red men lacked another leader as
capable as Tecumseh. Many Indians continued to congregate at Fort Wayne
in the years following the War of 1812. They came for reasons of trade or to
receive their annuities or possibly from a feeling of sympathy and attraction
for the scenes of their old home and gathering place, but aside from some
petty quarrels among themselves, nothing war-like was ever again manifested
in the relations of the Indians and whites at Fort Wayne.</p>

<br />Evacuation of the Fort and the Increased Indian Trade</h2>
<p>After peace came finally with the end of the struggles of 1812-15, the
scene around the fort was one of rare beauty. The extensive clearing made by
order of General Wayne in 1794, and again by General Harrison in 1812,
was covered with waving grass. Circling this was the green forest, pierced
by three gates through which flowed the gleaming rivers. The days of Indian
warfare had come to an end, the day of white settlement in numbers was yet
in anticipation.</p>
<p>The first year of peace, 1816, brought to the troops and the few families
at Fort Wayne a well founded feeling of security and comfort. This feeling of
security and comfort was not based upon the standard of today, for few could
endure now in comfort the life typified by the tallow dip and open fire, the
ox-cart and the pirogue. The national government realized the permanent
return of peace, and already had removed from the other western posts the
troops stationed there for the protection of the pioneers. But the time had not
yet arrived when the Washington authorities considered it wise to remove the
military garrison from Fort Wayne. The Indians still thronged here in large
numbers. Their periods of gathering to receive their annuities brought
hundreds to the little settlement and here, ofttimes, they remained for several
weeks.</p>
<p>Following the war, there was no settlement nearer than St. Mary&rsquo;s in
Ohio, and between Fort Wayne and Fort Dearborn (Chicago) only one white
man, a fur trader named Joseph Bertrand, had ventured to establish his abode
near the site of the present city of South Bend, Indiana. Until 1818, all of
northern Indiana was considered Indian territory.</p>
<p>However, this was not true in central and southern Indiana where
ever-increasing numbers of pioneers were settling. After the end of the War
of 1812 and the Napoleonic conflicts, a commercial depression hit the
eastern states, and multitudes sought new homes in the West. The seaboard
could no longer furnish the returned soldier nor the ruined merchant with
opportunities. This led to a rush of the people into the new country beyond the
mountains. The westward movement, in turn, gave an immediate demand
for highways of transportation.</p>
<p>Traffic over the rivers showed a steady increase over former years, and
the Maumee-Wabash portage once again became a busy pathway of
commerce. Chief Jean Baptiste Richardville, who was granted a license to
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
trade at Fort Wayne in 1815, nearly monopolized the carrying-trade over the
portage. Through this profitable business, and by the sale of the land granted
to him as chief of the Miamis in various treaties, Richardville became the
wealthiest Indian then living in American. In five treaties he acquired over
44 sections of land and $31,800. It is known that he had $200,000 in silver
alone at the time of his death in 1841.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_1" href="#fn_5_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The Miami chief established a place of business on the present
Columbia street in Fort Wayne and also one of his reserves was on the
Wabash river southwest of Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>In common with the people of the territory of Indiana, the citizens of
Fort Wayne rejoiced in the transformation of the territory into a state on April
29, 1816. At the time of the creation of the state of Indiana, all of
northeastern Indiana was included in Knox county, of which Vincennes was
the seat of government. In 1818, Randolph county was organized with
Winchester as the county seat. Fort Wayne was included in this latter
subdivision.</p>
<p>The new governor, Jonathan Jennings, in his first message to the
Indiana legislature, urged a prompt consideration of the establishment of
internal improvements, and especially a canal to connect the Maumee and
Wabash&mdash;a waterway which would supplant the centuries-old portage at
Fort Wayne. Despite the enthusiasm of many proponents of the canal, the
difficulties were many and work was not to begin on it for sixteen years.</p>
<p>The westward movement of the settlers brought about the transfer of
Major Whistler from Fort Wayne to St. Louis in 1817. The government
authorities assigned to the command of Fort Wayne, Major Josiah N. Vose of
the Fifth United States Infantry Regiment, who was destined to be the final
commandant of the post at the head of the Maumee.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_2" href="#fn_5_2">[2]</a> During a period of
about three months, from February 15 to May 31, 1817, before Major Vose
assumed his new duties, the garrison was under the command of First
Lieutenant Daniel Curtis, who had served with credit during the siege of
1812 and whose lively account of his experiences has been quoted.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_3" href="#fn_5_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A significant characteristic of Major Vose was his strict adherence to
the observance of Sunday in a religious way. John Johnston, who knew
Major Vose well, said in a letter written in 1859, that he was the only
commandant of the fort who publicly professed Christianity. It was his
constant practice, according to Johnston, to assemble his men on Sunday,
read the Scriptures to them, and talk with them in a conversational manner
about religion. Colonel Johnston adds, &ldquo;The conduct of such a man and
under such circumstances, can only be appreciated by persons familiar with
the allurements and temptations of military life.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_4" href="#fn_5_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>With Major Vose came Dr. Trevitt, assigned to the post as surgeon&rsquo;s
mate and Lieutenant James Clark. One of the first tasks undertaken under
Major Vose&rsquo;s direction was the erection of a new council house to replace the
one burned during the siege. It was a two-story structure, which in later years
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
was used as a school house and as a residence. The garrison in 1817
consisted of fifty-six men.</p>
<p>On October 6, 1818, the Miami nation ceded to the United States that
part of their land to the south and southwest of Fort Wayne. This section of
land lay between the Wabash near the mouth of the Racoon Creek and St.
Mary&rsquo;s river as far north as the portage at Fort Wayne. The treaty was
concluded at St. Mary&rsquo;s, Ohio, with Governor Jennings, Lewis Cass, and
Benjamin Parke, serving as commissioners of the United States and Chief
Richardville acting as principal spokesman for the Miamis. This treaty,
together with one concluded with the Wyandots the previous year, gave to
the United States complete ownership of the territory south of the Maumee
and Wabash rivers. Thus the way was opened for travel and settlement in
Indiana as far north as Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>According to the treaty of St. Mary&rsquo;s, many sections of land near Fort
Wayne were reserved for individuals designated by the Miamis. These
individuals included the following: Chief Jean Baptiste Richardville, Joseph
Richardville (the chief&rsquo;s son), Francis LaFontaine, the son of George Hunt,
Little Little Turtle, Josette Beaubien, Eliza C. Kercheval (daughter of
Benjamin Kercheval, sub-agent at Fort Wayne) John B. Bourie, Ann
Hackley (the daughter of William Wells), and the children of Maria
Christina DeRome and LaCros. A reading of these names indicates the
strong influence the early French traders had acquired over the Miamis by
intermarriage. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, Richardville&rsquo;s father,
Joseph Drouet de Richerville was a French trader.</p>
<p>The granting of individual reserves to the chiefs and other men favored
by the Indians in the treaty of 1818 led to a dangerous innovation in land and
Indian policy which later permitted the traders to grab the choice land sites
before the government attained control of it. In the later treaties the Indian
traders and agents combined their resources to secure the best sections of
land through the consent of the Indians in payment of actual or supposed
debts.</p>
<p>The year 1819 witnessed an important and significant change at Fort
Wayne, the departure of the troops and the abandonment of the fort as a
military stronghold. The formal evacuation took place on April 19, 1819, in
pursuance of orders issued by the Secretary of War. The treaty of St. Mary&rsquo;s
and the westward movement of the settlers had carried the frontier beyond
Fort Wayne. At the time of the departure of the troops, the garrison consisted
of Major Vose, one post surgeon, two captains, one first lieutenant, five
sergeants, four corporals, four musicians and seventy-five artillerymen and
privates&mdash;ninety-six men in all&mdash;in addition to a group of women and
children. Major Vose and his men went directly to Detroit by way of the
Maumee, in pirogues. They took from the fort its equipment of heavy
armament, including one six and one twelve-pounder cannon. Fort Wayne
was the last of the Indiana posts maintained by the government and had
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
served as an American fort for more than a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the news of the evacuation came as a shock to the
few families and the traders who had built their log houses just outside the
fort. When the day of departure came, the few settlers who comprised the
village felt a loneliness as their sense of security gave way for the moment to
a realization of the coming days of isolation and possible danger. In every
direction stretched unbroken wilderness and while the Indians had been
subdued, the abundance of whiskey given them by the traders made them at
times a menace to the safety of the village.</p>
<p>The fort buildings, vacated by the military, now came under the control
of the civil authorities, represented by the Indian agent, Benjamin Stickney.
For a number of years thereafter the wooden fort with its bastioned
blockhouses, officers&rsquo; quarters, and barracks, housed such civil, governmental,
and private enterprises as the Indian agency, the United States
land office, and the first Protestant mission school. Moreover, the opening
of the barracks to the settlers not only made safe and comfortable living
quarters for those already located there, but induced other settlers to choose
this immediate region. Even at this period, the shelter of the stockade
brought a feeling of security, and the fort was not without its convenient
firearms and supply of ammunition. For a considerable period all but those of
stoutest heart sought refuge within its walls with the coming of darkness.</p>
<p>Although the depression of 1819 in the Northwest checked the tide of
immigration temporarily, there were some travelers and homeseekers who
came to stamp their names upon the small settlement, which continued to be
known as Fort Wayne even after the evacuation of the troops. These settlers
included James Barnett, who was with Harrison&rsquo;s army of relief in 1812 and
who returned in 1818 as a permanent resident and trader; Paul Taber and his
sons, Cyrus and Samuel, and his daughter, Lucy, all of whom came in 1819;
Francis Comparet, who came in 1819, and who in 1820, together with
Alexis Coquillard and Benjamin B. Kercheval, established a post for the
American Fur Company at Fort Wayne; Dr. William Turner, a former post
surgeon, who returned to Fort Wayne in 1819 and later served for a short time
as Indian agent; and James Aveline who with his family came from
Vincennes to Fort Wayne in January, 1820.</p>
<p>Among these early settlers who found their way to Fort Wayne in 1819,
was Samuel Hanna, pioneer trader, judge, legislator, canal builder, railroad
enterpriser, and banker. In many respects, Samuel Hanna was to become
Fort Wayne&rsquo;s most active citizen as the small community grew from a mere
village to a city during his lifetime. Born in Scott county, Kentucky, in
October, 1797, and later moving to Dayton, Ohio, with his parents, he came
to Fort Wayne from St. Mary&rsquo;s Ohio, where he had been engaged in
supplying goods for the government during the Indian treaties of 1818. He
was twenty-two years old when he came to Fort Wayne. Hanna built at once a
log house on the site which later became the northwest corner of Barr and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
Columbia streets. Here, having formed a partnership with his brother-in-law,
James Barnett, a trading post was opened. Many of their goods which
came from the east were purchased from Abbott Lawrence at Boston; the
shipments were made by water to New York, thence up the Hudson river and
across to Buffalo, and from there to Fort Wayne by way of Lake Erie and the
Maumee.</p>
<p>Upon the abandonment of the fort by the military, the government sent
James Riley, a civil engineer, to Fort Wayne to survey the lands around the
fort belonging to the United States, preparatory to the sale of a portion of the
military reservation to the settlers. Riley was a noted author of that day,
having published in 1817 <i>Riley&rsquo;s Narrative</i>, a 554 page book on his
experiences in Africa as a slave of the Arabs. His prominence and the fact
that he was well known in Washington because he had spent several years
there, lent weight to his recommendations concerning the Fort Wayne lands.</p>
<p>On November 24, 1819, Riley wrote a letter from Fort Wayne to B.
Sanford, Esq., advising him that he had concluded his surveys for the season
but wanted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... to examine for myself the practicality of so uniting the Wabash with
the Maumee as to render intercourse by water between the Ohio river and
Lake Erie safe and easy through this channel.... The little Wabash rises in
an elevated swamp prairie six miles south of Fort Wayne, and joins the
Wabash eighteen miles hence. Thus in high stages of water, a portage of
only six miles carries merchandise from the level of the Maumee into the
navigable waters of the Wabash (and vice versa).&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_5" href="#fn_5_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These observations by Riley on the possibility of a canal were
supplemented in the same letter by his early impression of Fort Wayne as a
future center of population. He stated to Mr. Sanford:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The country around Fort Wayne is very fertile. The situation is
commanding and healthful.... Here will arise a town of great importance,
which must become a depot of immense trade. The fort is now only a
small stockade; no troops are stationed here, and less than thirty dwelling
houses occupied by French and American families form the whole
settlement.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_6" href="#fn_5_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Riley added that the departure of the soldiers had left this little band
of residents extremely lonely, but he predicted that as soon as the lands were
opened for sale the settlers would flock to this region. The people living at
Fort Wayne at this time had no right to the land and were considered as
&ldquo;squatters&rdquo; by the government officials.</p>
<p>Possibly the most interesting letter that James Riley wrote from Fort
Wayne was written near the close of the surveying season in 1820. It was
addressed to Edward Tiffin, Surveyor General. Riley had been in the
neighborhood of Fort Wayne, when a snow storm forced him to discontinue
his work temporarily. Taking advantage of his free time, Riley came to Fort
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Wayne to witness the annual distribution of the annuities to the Indians
gathered there. After speaking highly of the natural advantages of the site of
Fort Wayne, Riley urged that the government land be offered for sale as soon
as possible, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are now in its [Fort Wayne] immediate vicinity, more than 40
families of &lsquo;Squatters&rsquo; and traders, besides a great number of young men
each with his <i>bundle</i> or shop, of goods and trinkets; all of whom are
depredating on the public lands, for timber for their numberous buildings,
for fire-wood, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and as they have not interest in the soil, and little
hope of being able to purchase the land when sold, a system of waste and
destruction is going on, and is apparently entered into by all.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_6a" href="#fn_5_6a">[6a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Riley then added another reason why the lands should be sold. He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are now assembled, as I should judge, at least one thousand persons
from Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and New York, whose object is stated to
be that of trade with the Indians, in order to carry off some of their specie,
paid them by the Government. They have brought whiskey in abundance,
which they pretend to deposit with agent, until he shall have finished his
business with the Indians, but yet contrive to deal out large quantities
from their deposits in the woods, so that the savages are kept continually
drunk, and unfit for any business. Horse-racing, drinking, gambling, and
every kind of debauchery, extravagance and waste, are the order of the
day, and night too; and in my opinion, the savages themselves are the
most christianized, and least savage, of the two classes now congregated
here. Here the whites set example to the Indians too indelicate to mention,
and that cannot fail to produce in their minds disgust for the American
character.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_7" href="#fn_5_7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Riley concluded by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only means that occurs to my mind, of stopping this career of vice and
immorality, is the speedy survey and sale of the lands from the mouth of
the Maumee to this place; and from hence down and along the banks of the
Wabash.... Thus, a cordon of hardy and respectable settlers ... would be
formed along the Maumee and Wabash....  At present, there is no security
to him who locates himself on the public lands, nor do I wish there should
be; because every citizen ought to enjoy equal advantages. This place, if
laid out as a town and sold by the government, would bring a large sum of
money. The St. Mary&rsquo;s has been covered with boats, every freshet, for
several years past. This is a central spot, combining more natural
advantages to build up and support a town of importance, as a place of
deposit and trade ... than any point I have yet seen in the western
country.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_8" href="#fn_5_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter of Riley, which also contained a strong recommendation for
the careful survey of a canal route connecting the Wabash and the Maumee,
became a part of the official records of the surveyor-general&rsquo;s office, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
through this channel found its way into the congressional debates concerning
the Wabash and Erie canal.</p>
<p>Lest James Riley&rsquo;s severe arraignment of the white traders present
during the time of the annuity payments appear unjust, let us compare it with
the opinion of Reverend J. B. Finney, who visited the village during the
same period in the previous year. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was an awful scene for a sober man to look upon ... men and
women, raving maniacs, singing, dancing, fighting, stabbing and
tomahawking one another&mdash;and there were the rum-sellers watering their
whiskey until it was not strong grog, and selling it for four dollars a
gallon, their hired men gathering up all the skins and furs and their silver
brooches ... and their guns, tomahawks and blankets, till they were
literally stripped naked, and three or four were killed.... The reader may
set what estimates he pleases, or call him by what name; yet, if there were
ever a greater robber, or a meaner thief, or a dirtier murderer than these
rum sellers, he is yet to be seen.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_9" href="#fn_5_9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The laws for preventing the introduction of alcoholic drinks among the
Indians, though very severe, were ineffectual. A person might have
remained in the woods within five or six miles of Fort Wayne for a year
without being discovered by any government agent. It was the custom of the
traders to bring whiskey in kegs and hide it in the woods about half a mile
from the fort, a short time previous to the paying of the annuity, and when
the Indians came to the fort, to give information to such of the Indians who
could be confided in that there was whiskey to be had at those places. As
soon as the Indians received their money they would go off to the appointed
places.</p>
<p>Another reason that the Trade and Intercourse Act was so ineffectual at
Fort Wayne was the fact that it was almost impossible to bring any offender
to trial. The nearest court was at Winchester, Indiana, eighty miles away. A
few of the better traders of the region formed a society to prohibit this illegal
trade, but it soon dissolved when they found that their regulations could be
inforced only by action of the courts. When John Hays, Indian agent at Fort
Wayne reported that all the traders were guilty of selling whiskey to the
Indians, and asked for special authority to deal with them as he saw fit, the
government officials replied that they did not believe such authority was
necessary. No action was taken.</p>
<p>But these conditions at Fort Wayne prevailed to a large extent only
during the periods of the annuity distributions. It is of interest, then, to quote
the words of a man who made a &ldquo;between-times&rdquo; visit to the village. We
find him in the person of Major Stephen H. Long, a topographical engineer,
who visited the village in 1823. Wrote Major Long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Fort Wayne we made a stay of three days, and to a person visiting the
Indian country for the first time, this place offers many characteristic and
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
singular features. The village is small&mdash;it has grown under the shelter of
the fort.... The inhabitants are chiefly of Canadian origin, all more or less
inbued with the Indian blood. The confusion of tongues, owing to the
diversity of the Indian tribes which generally collect near a fort, make the
traveler imagine himself in a real babel.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_10" href="#fn_5_10">[10]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the fort, a cart track angled down to the river bank and
boatlanding, the bustling center of the town&rsquo;s traffic in furs; and three
embryonic roads, boggy and stump filled, let respectively northeast to
Detroit, northwest to Fort Dearborn and Lake Michigan, and southeast to
Fort Recovery, Ohio. Thomas Scattergood Teas, who visited the village in
1821, wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The settlement at this place consisted of about thirty log cabins and two
tolerably decent farm houses. The inhabitants are nearly all French-Canadians.
The fort stands at the lower end of the village ... the barracks
are occupied by the Indian agent, the Baptist missionary and some private
families.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_11" href="#fn_5_11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Baptist missionary, of whom Teas speaks, was the Reverend Isaac
McCoy who came with his wife and seven children to Fort Wayne on May
15, 1820, and stayed for over two years at the fort. McCoy wished to go
farther into the Indian country, but as he states, &ldquo;necessity not choice
compelled us to consent to go to Fort Wayne.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_12" href="#fn_5_12">[12]</a> Despite the predilection of
some of the Indians for the Catholic faith as a result of long contacts with
French traders and past remembrances of the French Jesuits, McCoy
collected a fairly large number of Indian children for his school at Fort
Wayne.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_13" href="#fn_5_13">[13]</a> The authorities at Fort Wayne afforded McCoy every encouragement,
although the Indian agent, John Hays, later regretted the fact that he
allowed McCoy to use the barracks for housing the children. The forty
half-civilized children racing around his offices, nearly drove the agent to
distraction, besides destroying a great deal of government property.</p>
<p>Of the five instructors engaged from time to time to aid in teaching the
Indians, none remained over a period of three months. The McCoys found
the necessities of life very dear at Fort Wayne; flour was obtainable only
by long transportation and corn was also scarce. In the year 1821, the mission
was saved from closing by receipt from the United States Government of
four hundred and fifty dollars. This money was taken from a fund of ten
thousand dollars appropriated by Congress for civilizing the Indians.
Because of the steady demoralization of the Indians around Fort Wayne
brought about by the traders&rsquo; whiskey, McCoy decided to move his mission
in 1822. A new mission was established one hundred miles northwest of Fort
Wayne on the St. Joseph of Lake Michigan River.</p>
<p>A change in the management of the Indian agency at Fort Wayne took
place in 1819 when Benjamin F. Stickney was transferred to a post on the
lower Maumee and Dr. William Turner was named to succeed him. Stickney
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
had served for nine years, and during this time, like all agents, had made
many enemies. General Duncan McArthur writing from Chillicothe, Ohio,
as early as March, 1815, informed Secretary of War James Monroe, that
Colonel Lewis, a Shawnee chief had placed before him severe criticisms of
Stickney&rsquo;s methods. &ldquo;The Indians are generally displeased with Mr.
Stickney as an agent,&rdquo; added General McArthur, &ldquo;and several of them have
requested me to make it known to the president and solicit his removal. He is
certainly not well qualified to discharge the duties of an Indian agent.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_14" href="#fn_5_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>As a federal Indian agent, Stickney was responsible for the fate of
numerous whites and Indians. Among his duties at that time were the
licensing of traders and the settlement of their claims and disputes with the
tribes, enforcement of the intercourse regulations, disbursement of annuities
and gifts, and expenditure of funds for improvements, and the punishment of
unruly Indians. Tactful handling of these problems and of numerous
squabbles between the two races was an invaluable factor in preventing
bloodshed and preserving good relations. Stickney was inclined to be too
arrogant in dealing with the Indians, and at times seemed to lack any
humanitarian feeling toward those under his care.</p>
<p>On April 20, 1818, Congress passed an act which consolidated the
agencies of Fort Wayne and Piqua, and John Johnston was appointed agent
for the agency thus formed. In effect this left Stickney out of the service, but
as it was impossible for Johnston to take care of the Fort Wayne agency as
well as that of Piqua, Stickney remained at Fort Wayne as sub-agent.</p>
<p>Stickney continued to serve under this arrangement through the year
1818, though there appears to have developed a degree of friction between
the sub-agent and his superiors. Governor Lewis Cass of Michigan, writing
in January, 1819, to John Calhoun, Secretary of War, said, &ldquo;...
circumstances have occurred at Fort Wayne which have had a tendency to
injure the usefulness of Mr. Stickney there.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_15" href="#fn_5_15">[15]</a> What these circumstances
were we do not know, other than a supposition that Stickney might have
made many powerful enemies among the traders at Fort Wayne. This was
quite likely due to the nature of the Indian trade and the power of the agent.
Lewis Cass was not one to disregard the complaints of the traders, as he
usually supported the large trading companies, in particular Astor&rsquo;s
American Fur Company. As a perennial political appointee, Cass found it
worthwhile to have friends among these influential traders, and as
Stickney&rsquo;s superior in the Indian Department, Cass was in all likelihood
inclined to support the traders in any quarrel that might have developed. In
commenting on the charges brought against himself by some of the traders at
Fort Wayne in 1824, John Tipton, another agent, wrote to John Calhoun,
&ldquo;You will no doubt recollect that Mr. Stickney while Agt here was harassed
with charges and all kinds of persecution.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_16" href="#fn_5_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Under these circumstances, which we can only surmise, Benjamin
Stickney left the agency in 1820 and moved to Toledo, where he later gained
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
prominence as a leader in the fight to keep that section of the country under
the government of the state of Ohio rather than the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>Dr. William Turner, Stickney&rsquo;s successor, had been stationed at Fort
Wayne between 1810-12 as garrison surgeon&rsquo;s mate. On April 7, 1813, he
was promoted to surgeon in the Seventeenth Infantry. He resigned from the
army on January 31, 1815, returned to Fort Wayne as a private citizen, and
married Anne Wells, daughter to Captain William Wells. On March 6, 1819,
he was appointed agent for the Miami, Eel River, and other Indians, and in
1820, assumed all of Stickney&rsquo;s duties. Because of ill health, Turner began
to drink considerably, and within a year, on May 24, 1820, Calhoun
informed him of his removal from office in consequence of &ldquo;unsatisfactory
conduct.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_17" href="#fn_5_17">[17]</a> However, the affairs of the agency were not turned over to his
successor, John Hays, until August, 1820. Turner died at Fort Wayne in
1821.</p>
<p>At a time when the story of Indian relations was a sordid and corrupt
one, revealing on the part of traders, agents, and officials of the Indian
administration a baseness and moral depravity that was unusual even for the
nineteenth century, John Hays stands out as one of the few agents who could
not be classed in such a group. Hays was born in New York City in 1770.
While a youth, he engaged in the Indian trade as a clerk in a trading house in
Canada. In 1793 he settled at Cahokia, Illinois, where he held a number of
government positions until his appointment at Fort Wayne. Unfortunately
for the Indians of this area, Hays remained at Fort Wayne less than three
years.</p>
<p>John Hays was never happy at Fort Wayne, despite his good work. He
could not bring his family here, as they were too numerous to move a great
distance, and the five hundred miles to Cahokia was also too far for Hays to
visit them. Furthermore, Hays became disgusted when he found that by his
own efforts, he was helpless in checking the traders from furnishing the
Indians whiskey. On one occasion the traders combined against him to
prevent the issuance of a presidential order curtailing the amount of whiskey
brought to Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>Hays also urged the appointment of a sub-agent to assist him in
controlling the situation, and the reestablishment of a military force at Fort
Wayne. &ldquo;It is neither [at] Chicago, Green Bay, Prairie du Chien, Falls of St.
Anthony, Rock River, or any part of the Mississippi or even Michilimakanac
... that in my opinion a Military force would be more necessary.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_18" href="#fn_5_18">[18]</a> he
wrote to John Calhoun. The opinion of Hays was not one to be lightly put
aside, as it was he, who on the strength of his wide experience, furnished
information on the routes for the armies and the distribution of forces from
Montreal to Michilimackinac during the War of 1812.</p>
<p>Owing to the disapproval of his proposal by Governor Cass, head of the
Fort Wayne agency, none of Hays&rsquo; suggestions were adopted, however.
Hays was often at odds with Cass as to the manner of dealing with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
Indians. In one instance, Hays had been having particular trouble with the
Potawatomies under Metea. These Indians objected to traveling to Detroit to
receive their annuity rather than coming to Fort Wayne, which was almost a
hundred miles closer to their village, near the present site of South Bend,
Indiana. Hays, therefore, agreed that the next payments should be made at
Fort Wayne, but Cass ignored the agreement and ordered the Indians to come
to Detroit. After they arrived, Cass reproached them for crossing into
Canada to receive British gifts. Metea bitingly replied that they would gladly
give up the practice, if the Americans gave out the annuities at Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>During his second year at Fort Wayne, Hays was obliged to reduce his
expenditures from $5,000 to less than $3,000 in line with a general reduction
of funds for the Indian Department. At the same time, he needed money to
repair the agency quarters within the fort, which were fast decaying. Added
to the decay was the destruction brought about by Reverend Isaac McCoy&rsquo;s
Indian school children living within the fort. The property of the agency at
this time was listed as &ldquo;public dwellings inside the stockade, five dwelling
houses outside the fort, one blacksmith shop, one coal house, one root
house, one stable, two pastures, one timothy meadow, and one field all
fenced.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_19" href="#fn_5_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>While John Hays was Indian agent at Fort Wayne, Benjamin Berry
Kercheval served as his assistant at a salary of $500 a year. Kercheval was
born at Winchester, Virginia, April 9, 1793, and went to Detroit when he
was eighteen. Around 1818, Kercheval came to Fort Wayne and here served
for a time as an interpreter for Benjamin Stickney. Later he became a
representative of the American Fur Company, a position he held when he
was employed by Hays. Hays used Kercheval a great deal and trusted him
implicitly. In 1821, the birth of a daughter to Benjamin Kercheval and his
wife, formerly Maria Forsythe, was an event of such interest to the Indians
that they shortly adopted the child with solemn ceremonies as a member of
the Miami tribe.</p>
<p>The national government recognized the growing importance of Fort
Wayne in the establishment of a post office in 1820. Although Samuel Hanna
was in reality the first man to serve as postmaster at Fort Wayne, Kercheval
whose commission bore the date of February 4, was the first appointee of
President Monroe. Hanna established the office in his store, after Kercheval
evidently had declined to serve.</p>
<p>At this time there was one mail every two weeks from Cincinnati, and
the only newspaper to find its way to the pioneer village regularly was the
<i>Liberty Hall</i> from Cincinnati. In 1822, in response to the demands of the
town, the government established regular routes between Fort Wayne and
Chicago, as well as the Ohio villages on the St. Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The chief industry of the village in these early years continued to
be trade with the Indians, either for their furs and peltries or for their
annuity money. With the end of the Indian wars, the Miamis and
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
neighboring tribes once more found time for hunting and trapping. At
the same time the establishment of European peace in 1815, at the end
of the Napoleonic era, brought about a sharp rise in the price of furs.
New and powerful traders began to operate in the Maumee-Wabash area
with many coming to Fort Wayne as the central point of the region.</p>
<p>We have already noted the firm established by Samuel Hanna and his
brother-in-law, James Barnett in 1819. A year later the American Fur
Company, operating from Detroit and owned by John Jacob Astor,
established an important branch at Fort Wayne. Benjamin Kercheval,
Alexis Coquillard, and Francis Comparet were its first representatives.
Comparet and Coquillard, both came directly from Detroit for the purpose of
establishing the company&rsquo;s branch house at Fort Wayne. Comparet remained
at Fort Wayne permanently, but Coquillard later established a trading station
on the St. Joseph river of Lake Michigan, on the site of the city of South
Bend, as an outpost of the company&rsquo;s establishment at Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>In 1822, the family of Alexander Ewing came to Fort Wayne from Troy,
Ohio. The Ewing family consisted of Alexander Ewing, an old Pennsylvania
trader, his wife, Charlotte, three daughters&mdash;Charlott, Lavina, and
Louisa&mdash;, and four sons&mdash;Charles, who became president judge of the
circuit court of Indiana, Alexander H., who later became a prosperous
Cincinnati merchant, and George W. and William G., who became
associated with their father in the trading establishment.</p>
<p>Alexander Ewing with his sons, George W. and William G., did
business under the name of &ldquo;A. Ewing and Sons&rdquo;. After the older Ewing&rsquo;s
death in 1826, the firm became &ldquo;W. G. and G. W. Ewing.&rdquo; The Ewings
became known for their real-estate and fur-trading operations, the latter on a
scale that made them rivals of the American Fur Company in the Great Lakes
region. At first the two firms were friendly toward each other, but a trade war
which eventually broke out between the two companies in 1828 resulted in
the bankruptcy of the American Fur Company five year later. The Ewings
also found it profitable to advance goods to the Indians, thereby presenting
large claims against the annuity payments for the Indians. The Ewings had
branch houses in Logansport, Largro, and Peru, and posts in Missouri,
Iowa, Michigan, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, at the height of their
business interests.</p>
<p>The year 1822 also brought to Fort Wayne the families of William
Nesbit Hood and his brother, Robert Hood, who came from Dayton, Ohio.
The Hoods also secured a license for trading with the Indians. Although
successful in their operations, they never entered into large scale trading
such as the Ewings, and later became involved in politics and real estate
speculation.</p>
<p>Most of the traders at Fort Wayne seldom left town, but had a number of
men called &ldquo;engages&rdquo; in their service who accompanied the Indians in their
hunts, supplied them with goods in small quantities, and watched them that
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
they did not sell their furs to traders other than their employers. The furs
brought in consisted principally of deer and raccoon skins. Bear, otter, and
beaver were becoming scarce. In the eighteen-thirties, when the beaver
prices tumbled and the raccoon skins became popular, the Maumee-Wabash
region became for a few years the center of interest of the American fur
trade, as this area produced large numbers of raccoons.</p>
<p>The skins when brought in were loosely rolled or tied, but they were
afterward made into packs which were three feet long and eighteen inches
wide after being subjected to a heavy pressure in a wedge press. The values
of the furs were nominal, as they were paid for in goods passed off to the
Indians for two or three times their actual worth. Moreover, fur prices
fluctuated greatly, depending upon the fashion.</p>
<p>On February 24, 1823, John Hays wrote to Calhoun tendering his
resignation as Indian agent at Fort Wayne, pointing out that he was too far
from his home at Cahokia, Illinois. After elaborating on the benefits the
Indians had received under his administration of the agency, he strongly
recommended that Benjamin B. Kercheval, his present assistant, be
appointed as his successor. Kercheval was an excellent man for the position,
but did not receive the appointment, as Hays had allowed the news of his
intended resignation to leak out before writing to Calhoun. As the fears of
British intrigue around Fort Wayne had vanished after the War of 1812, the
agency at Fort Wayne came to be regarded as a political plum. The state
delegation in Congress had been exerting pressure on the president for some
time to appoint citizens of Indiana to positions in the state. Calhoun, early in
1822, had refused to remove Hays in order that John Tipton, a native of
Indiana, could be appointed in his place. However, when the Indiana
delegation heard of Hay&rsquo;s intended resignation, they carried the matter of
their recommendation of Tipton directly to President Monroe and secured his
approval before Calhoun had the opportunity to recommend Kercheval.
When Kercheval brought the news of his failure to Hays, the latter wrote to
Lewis Cass, &ldquo;I never was more disappointed and mortified than on the
arrival of Mr. Kercheval. I certainly should not have resigned at this
moment, had I not thought Mr. Kercheval would be successfull.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_22" href="#fn_5_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Hays remained at Fort Wayne until June 5, 1823, and for a short time
both he and Tipton were present at the agency. John Tipton was a product of
the east Tennessee frontier, where he was born in 1786. When he was seven,
his father was killed by an Indian. In 1807, the Tipton family moved to
Harrison County, Indiana. Although he lacked any formal education,
Tipton&rsquo;s dynamic qualities as a leader more than compensated for his
educational shortcomings. In later life, Tipton learned to read and write, but
it always remained a difficult task for him, judging by his letters. In 1811,
Tipton took part as a common soldier in the battle of Tippecanoe. Afterward
his advancement in the army was astonishingly rapid, for in six years, he
became a brigadier general. After the War of 1812, Tipton&rsquo;s rise in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
political field was equally as rapid and his influence became statewide. The
political positions he held were as follows: justice of the peace, deputy
sheriff, sheriff, member of the state legislature, state commissioner, Indian
agent at Fort Wayne, and finally U. S. Senator.</p>
<p>In 1823, Tipton was glad to accept the position as Indian agent at Fort
Wayne for life at Corydon, his former home, had become unpleasantly
complicated by financial and domestic difficulties. His marriage to Martha
Shields had ended with a divorce in 1817. The salary of the Indian agent was
$1,200 a year, a fair income in those days. The position also gave Tipton
special advantages in the treaty negotiations to secure choice sites of land
either for his friends or for himself. It was primarily through this means that
Tipton was well on his way to becoming one of the wealthiest men in the
state at the time of his death. Obviously Tipton&rsquo;s financial and political
success were closely linked. In today&rsquo;s society the public and private
&ldquo;conflict of interest&rdquo; in his career would be grist for many crusading
journalists. However in an age when the &ldquo;Spoils System&rdquo; would soon
become acceptable and in a small isolated frontier community where the
agent had to deal constantly with the same few individuals, his career should
also be judged in relation to the time and place. Tipton was not insensible to
the needs of the Indians under his care, but he usually decided on the issues
with his personal and political future in mind.</p>
<p>When Tipton received his appointment there were only 2,441 Miami,
Potawatomie and Eel River Indians left in the territory covered by the Fort
Wayne agency. In 1824, their annuities amounted to $17,300 for the
Miamis, $1,100 for the Eel River Indians, and $1,700 for the Potawatomies.
These annuities, which increased threefold during Tipton&rsquo;s administration,
were a stake well worth effort of the traders. Moreover, added to these
annuities were the gifts and other contingencies which the government
furnished the Indians and had to buy from the traders. The traders in the
vicinity of Fort Wayne realized the fur trade was declining, but they also
knew the Indians sill needed their goods and encouraged then to buy heavily
on credit. The Indians recognized these debts, some of which were artificial
even, and before the annuities were paid, the traders made sure they received
their payments. What was left for the Indians was either spent on whiskey or
in buying more goods. There was no limit to the greed of many of the traders.
Finding the annuities inadequate, they joined with the Indians in asking for
increased payments by the government and conspired to hold up treaty
agreements until demands were granted.</p>
<p>The outstanding incident of Tipton&rsquo;s second year as agent was his
seizure of goods belonging to the powerful American Fur Company for
violation of the Intercourse Act on the part of two of their clerks at Fort
Wayne. Tipton&rsquo;s action was upheld by a jury in the United States district
court, and the goods were declared forfeited. However, when the case was
carried to the United States Supreme Court, the judgement was reversed, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
the case was ordered back to the district court, where it was finally
dismissed.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_23" href="#fn_5_23">[23]</a> Whatever the legal merits of the case, it was clear that not even
someone with Tipton&rsquo;s political influence could challenge the important
traders, especially Astor&rsquo;s American Fur Company.</p>

<br />Platting of Fort Wayne and the First Local Government</h2>
<p>While the traders, large and small alike, were thus successfully evading
any effective control over their operations, Fort Wayne was developing from
a frontier army post and portage center into a very prosperous community.
Its strategic location, the opening of a land office in 1822 and its selection as
the county seat of Allen county brought many new settlers to the area.</p>
<p>The land office was established at Fort Wayne by an act of Congress on
May 8, 1822.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_1" href="#fn_6_1">[1]</a> The coming of Joseph Holman of Wayne county, appointed
by President Monroe to serve as the first register of the land office, and
Captain Samuel C. Vance of Dearborn county, as the receiver of the public
moneys, was the signal for great activity in securing the choicest sites when
the sale should open in the fall of 1823.</p>
<p>Register Holman and Captain Vance established their office in the old
fort where much of the clerical work of the business came under the direct
supervision of a young man who accompanied Captain Vance as his
assistant, Allen Hamilton. Hamilton later became one of the most foremost
merchants in the Fort Wayne area. He was born in Tyrone county, Ireland in
1798 and came to America in 1817 to retrieve the family wealth which had
been lost by his father. In this he was quite successful after arriving at Fort
Wayne. As a trader, he became a good friend of the Miamis, and in particular
Chief Richardville. In this manner he was generally able to obtain choice
land sites from the Indians in exchange for payment of their debts. He and
Tipton later became partners in buying and improving Indian lands for
speculation. In political affairs he was not so successful, later incurring the
powerful opposition of the Ewings by reason of his friendship with the
American Fur Company.</p>
<p>The act that set up the land office at Fort Wayne provided that all public
lands for which the Indian title had been extinguished and which had not
been granted to or secured for the use of any individual or individuals or
appropriated and reserved for any other purpose were to be opened for sale.
It was necessary to make some decision about the fort and public buildings
which had been used by the Indian agency since the withdrawal of the
garrison in 1819. Upon the recommendation of Lewis Cass, the site of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
fort and thirty acres additional were withheld from the sale in order that the
Indians assembling for councils or annuity payments might have a place for
encampment. The land speculators were bitterly disappointed and made
periodic efforts to secure part of the valuable reserve. Tipton was one of the
principal opponents of its sale as long as the agency remained at Fort
Wayne.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_2" href="#fn_6_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>On October 22, 1823&mdash;the thirty-third anniversary of Harmar&rsquo;s defeat
on this same spot, and the twenty-ninth anniversary of the dedication of the
original fort&mdash;the government land sale was opened in the fort. John T. Barr,
a merchant of Baltimore, Maryland, and John McCorkle, an active citizen of
Piqua, Ohio, combined their resources and purchased the tract which is
known as the Original Plat.</p>
<p>Neither of these original proprietors of Fort Wayne chose to make his
home here. Nothing is known of the activities of John T. Barr in Baltimore,
beyond the showing of the Baltimore city directories of his period, which
refer to him as a merchant. More is known, however, of the activities of John
McCorkle. He was born at Piqua in 1791. As the owner of a carding mill,
gristmill and oil mill, he laid the foundation for a prosperous future and
became Piqua&rsquo;s most enterprising citizen. In 1819, together with John
Hedges, he furnished supplies of beef and bread to the Indians at Fort Wayne
while they were awaiting their annuity payments. Two years later he founded
St. Mary&rsquo;s, Ohio. He was actively engaged in state and national politics in
1829, when he died at the age of thirty-eight.</p>
<p>Barr and McCorkle came to the Fort Wayne land sale together, in a
bateau, which they propelled down the St. Mary&rsquo;s river. For the original
tract, they paid twenty-six dollars per acre, in that year an extravagant price
for western land.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_3" href="#fn_6_3">[3]</a> They took immediate steps to plat the property and to offer
it for sale in the form of business and residence lots. A surveyor was
employed to lay out the property which today would include that part of
Downtown Fort Wayne bounded on the north by the Nickel Plate Railroad,
on the east by Barr Street, on the south by Washington Boulevard, and on the
west by the alley between Calhoun and Harrison streets. The plat consisted
originally of 110 lots. There were four north-and-south streets and five
east-and-west streets.</p>
<p>Alexander Ewing secured eighty acres of ground immediately west of
the Barr and McCorkle tract. This later became known as &ldquo;Ewing&rsquo;s
addition&rdquo;. The tract known as &ldquo;Wells pre-emption&rdquo;, lying between the
forks of the St. Mary&rsquo;s and St. Joseph rivers, having been set aside by
Congress for Captain Wells as early as 1808, was purchased by his heirs at
the minimum price of $1.25 an acre.</p>
<p>The land offices were continued at Fort Wayne during the period of
twenty-one years. The positions connected with it were considered excellent
rewards for political service. Thus, with the inauguration of Jackson in 1829
Holman and Vance were removed. Later appointees were also appointed or
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
removed according to the political fortune of their parties.</p>
<p>While the proprietors of their newly purchased land were busy
preparing for the sale of lots, the state legislature on December 11, 1823,
passed an act creating the county of Allen, with jurisdiction over what is now
Wells, Adams, DeKalb, and Steuben counties and portions of Noble,
LaGrange, Huntington, and Whitley counties.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_4" href="#fn_6_4">[4]</a> This area included practically
all of northwestern Indiana. The name of Allen county was suggested
by John Tipton, who was an ardent admirer of Colonel John Allen, the
gallant Kentuckian who, after aiding in the relief of Fort Wayne in 1812, lost
his life at the battle of the River Raisin in Michigan.</p>
<p>Barr and McCorkle awaited the organization of the county government,
after which they proceeded with the work of securing returns on their
investments. At this time there were no streets beyond beaten paths and
driveways which had, by chance, come into accepted use whenever one man
chose to walk or drive over a route taken by another before him. However,
with the laying out of the streets for the future town, the site assumed an air of
order and enterprises. There was work for all.</p>
<p>The legislative act creating Allen county took effect April 1, 1824. Six
days previous to this date, four state commissioners arrived to select the seat
of government for the new county. Throughout the West the various town
promoters frequently fought vigorously to have <i>their</i> community selected as
county seat. This usually led to fierce rivalries between neighboring towns.
However in the case of Allen county, Fort Wayne faced no competition due
to its dominant position in location and population, it being the only village
of any size in northeastern Indiana. These commissioners, in accordance
with instructions from the state legislature, held their session at the tavern of
Alexander Ewing, known as Washington Hall, and soon completed the
formalities of their mission.</p>
<p>The first election of county officers occurred on May 22. Previous to
this, Governor William Hendricks had named Allen Hamilton to serve as
sheriff of Allen county. The election of county officers was held in
accordance with the sheriff&rsquo;s proclamation. Although partisan politics did
not enter into it, the race was a heated one, as indicated by the attempt of the
defeated candidates to contest the election.</p>
<p>The voters selected Samuel Hanna and Benjamin Cushman for
associate circuit court judges; Anthony Davis for clerk and recorder; and
William Rockhill, James Wyman, and Francis Comparet for county
commissioners. Alexander Ewing, a rival of Samuel Hanna, and Marshall
K. Taylor, who ran against Comparet, contested the election, claiming that
there was an unfair count of the ballots. However, they failed to prove their
charges.</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the commissioners, John Tipton was appointed
to the important post of county agent. The commissioners also fixed the
following figures to regulate the rates to be charged by tavernkeepers, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
were required to pay an annual license fee of $12.50 to conduct their
business: Dinner, breakfast, and supper 25 cents; keeping horse, night and
day, 50 cents; lodging per night 12&frac12; cents; whiskey, per half pint 12&frac12; cents;
brandy, per half pint, 50 cents; gin per half pint, 37&frac12; cents; cider, per quart,
18 cents.</p>
<p>The board also decided upon the following rates for assessment on
personal property for the year of 1824: Male person, over the age of 21 years,
50 cents; horse or mule, 37&frac12; cents; work oxen, 19 cents; gold watch, $1;
silver watch, 25 cents; pinchbeck watch, 25 cents; pleasure carriage, four
wheels, $1.50; pleasure carriage, two wheels, $1.00.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_5" href="#fn_6_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Treasurer Holman reported that in 1824 the county was entitled to
$111.62 from taxes. The state at that time, and for a long period to follow,
paid a bounty on all wolf scalps taken; the certificates thus issued were
receivable for tax payments. For the first years, nearly all the taxes of Allen
county were paid off in these certificates, a clear indication of the wild nature
of the Fort Wayne area.</p>
<p>The first session of the Allen County circuit court was held beginning
August 9, 1824, at Ewing&rsquo;s tavern, with Judges Cushman and Hanna
presiding. The records of the opening years of the county&rsquo;s judicial history
reveal the fact that very few of the leading citizens escaped indictment on
charges of selling liquor illegally, larceny, assault and battery, gambling,
defamation of character, or trespassing, while the civil and chancery cases
were numerous from the beginning.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_6" href="#fn_6_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The report of the first grand jury, which was received no doubt with
complacency by the community, would if duplicated at the present time
precipitate official investigations and loss of positions. But it reflects the
spirit of the time in early Fort Wayne. Both of the associate judges were
indicted for minor offenses. Of the nine defendants charged with illegal sale
of liquors, the large part were men whose names are synonymous with the
builders of early Fort Wayne. Six of those accused of the illegal sale of liquor
paid fines of three dollars, while the remaining three drew fines of four
dollars each. Apparently it was well worth such small fines to be able to trade
with the Indians, and the practice continued.</p>
<p>The most important matter to come before the county commissioners in
1824 was the proposition of John T. Barr and John McCorkle in regard to the
town plat which they had laid out in August. The offer included a grant to the
county treasury of $500 cash and the donation to the county of one square for
the use of public buildings (the present Court House square), one lot for a
school building, and one lot for a church of no particular denomination, but
free to all. In addition to this, Barr and McCorkle offered various other lots
located throughout the plat to be disposed of by the county.</p>
<p>The commissioners lost little time in accepting this offer, and the town
of Fort Wayne consisting of about sixteen square blocks came into existence.
The deed was made out to John Tipton, the county agent. The first lots were
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
sold September 18, 1824, under the direction of Tipton. The buyers were
Francis Comparet, William Barbee, William Suttenfield, Edward Mitchel,
Thomas Rue, Charles W. Ewing, Rees Goodwin, John J. Griggs, Benjamin
Kercheval, Christopher Vallequitte, Jean B. Richardville, Alexander
Ewing, William Murphy, Benjamin Archer, Moses Scott, James Scott,
William N. Hood, Jacob Everly, Walker and Davis, Samuel Hanna, and
Benjamin and Jacob Glossbruner.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_7" href="#fn_6_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Some of these lots, in the heart of the present city, sold for $10.25; the
highest brought only $25. The entire thirty-six lots comprising this original
sale netted only $690.50, an average of less than $20. per lot. Most of the
purchasers made a down payment of half the purchase price. After the sale of
some of the remaining lots, Tipton resigned as county agent on September 5,
1825, and Charles W. Ewing was appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>With the selection of Fort Wayne as the county seat and the
improvement and sale of the public lands, new settlers began to arrive in
1824. One of these was Hugh Hanna, the brother of Samuel Hanna, who
established the first cabinet and carpenter shop. The villagers were
becoming prosperous enough to build more permanent homes and furnish
them with better furniture. Chief Richardville and Samuel Hanna, following
the best tradition in the East, imported most of their household furnishings
from France.</p>
<p>Another indication that Fort Wayne was becoming a village for the
more permanent type of settler was the establishment of a small brick factory
north of the town by Benjamin Archer who also arrived in 1824. From the
products of his yards the first brick building at Fort Wayne was constructed
near the end of that year.</p>
<p>Other settlers of 1824 were Mrs. Peter Edsall and her nine children. At
Fort Wayne the family purchased a farm. Later her sons&mdash;Samuel, John
Simon, and William&mdash;became identified in the developments of the town,
establishing saw mills, laying plank roads, and finally contracting for the
construction of the first railroad to reach Fort Wayne. William Stewart,
Smalwood Noel, John Bruno, Charles and Francis Minie, Richard Chobert,
and Joseph Barron also came to the village in 1824. Most of these people
came from Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia by way of the Ohio and St. Mary&rsquo;s
rivers. A few of them came from the Detroit region or from New York state
by way of Lake Erie and the Maumee river.</p>

<br />The Treaty of 1826 and the Removal of the Indian Agency</h2>
<p>The year 1825 found the village of Fort Wayne had developed to a town
of nearly one hundred and fifty people&mdash;that is to say of persons considered
more or less permanently settled. The town was in the pathway of many who
traveled by way of the rivers, passing chiefly to the southwest; so there was a
closer business and social connection with the busy eastern centers than had
prevailed during the earlier years.</p>
<p>In many respects the growth of Fort Wayne was typical of what was
happening elsewhere in the West. The Indian country, opened to the whites
by the treaties between 1795 and 1818, was being speedily settled. The
&ldquo;New Purchase&rdquo; acquired from the Miami and Potawatomie in 1818 was
carved into twenty-two counties and a flood of settlers rushed in to take up
the choice locations. In 1829 it was estimated that a hundred thousand people
were living in the New Purchase. In 1820, but four years a state, Indiana
boasted a population of 147,178 people, and the next census revealed the
addition of 195,853. In 1826, the northern third of Indiana was held by less
than three thousand Indians while the southern two-thirds was settled by one
hundred times as many whites. Within a short time pressure of the whites,
who lusted for the rich land north of the Wabash-Maumee line, led to an
inexorable demand for Indian removal.</p>
<p>Fort Wayne as a central point along this line of the Maumee and Wabash
river, and at the edge of the white civilization, while touching the Indian
country, held a unique and paradoxical position. The traders and land
speculators at Fort Wayne&mdash;the Ewings, Hamilton, Hanna, Barnett, Hood,
Comparet, Coquillard, and others&mdash;were making a handsome profit in their
dealings with the Indians. As long as the Indian agency remained at Fort
Wayne, and as long as the Indians remained in this area and received
ever-better annuities, these men profited. Removal of the Indians, as
William G. Ewing pointed out, would deprive the area of many
thousands of dollars distributed annually. This money, he maintained,
contributed to the upbuilding of the area.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_1" href="#fn_7_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>However, it must be remembered that there was a factor, especially
important at Fort Wayne, which made the removal of the Indians very
desirable. The craze for internal improvements had struck throughout the
West in the eighteen-twenties. In Indiana the most-discussed and most-promising
project was the proposed Wabash and Erie Canal, for which the
portage at Fort Wayne was the focal point. Many of these traders at Fort
Wayne had through their astuteness in business with the Indians acquired
valuable property along the route of the proposed canal. Nevertheless, the
Indians still held the territory north of the Wabash and Maumee, and their
removal was necessary for the work to be able to proceed. In the final
analysis, it became a question of which interest was more powerful, the
Indian traders and fur companies or the larger group of land speculators,
town-site promoters, merchants, and settlers of the Wabash and Maumee
valleys. It was inevitable that the latter group should win out, but at Fort
Wayne the struggle was a bitter one. Here we see some of the traders, such as
Hanna, placed in the paradoxical position of agitating for the removal of the
Indians, while at the same time eager to retain their trade. Others, in
particular the Ewings, opposed their removal. Both groups had acquired
valuable property along the proposed canal line, but those who sided with the
Ewings had more money invested in their trading operations with the Indians
and usually dealt in the fur trade also.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_2" href="#fn_7_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Somewhere between both groups stood John Tipton, Indian agent.
Tipton never doubted that Indiana was destined to be a white man&rsquo;s country.
He thoroughly agreed with the popular demand for internal improvements
and for the removal of the Indians. He himself was one of the major holders
of choice land, which he had acquired from the Indians and which he hoped
to develop. But as Indian agent he had to account for his acts to the
Washington officials as well as to opinion in Indiana. Moreover, he was not
callous to the sorry plight of the once powerful Miami and Potawatomie,
whose contact with the white traders had reduced them to pitiful tribes.
Then, too, Tipton could not openly flaunt the powerful traders, who wanted
the Indians to remain. Tipton&rsquo;s position as Indian agent was recognized as
one of the best political appointments in Indiana. His hold on his position
depended on his ability to keep in the good graces of the Indiana delegation
in Congress, and this in turn necessitated making as few enemies as possible.
Moreover, Tipton realized that the traders could prevent the negotiation of
any treaty and the cession of land by the Indians by reason of their powerful
influence with the chiefs. Failure to secure these cessions periodically would
ruin any Indian agent.</p>
<p>By 1826 Tipton was ready to act. He felt that the Miamis and
Potawatomies were sufficiently softened by their growing dependence on
government annuities and on the whiskey and other goods furnished by the
traders to be amenable to proposals for another land cession. Accordingly, a
commission of Tipton, Lewis Cass, and Governor James Ray of Indiana was
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
appointed to deal with the Indians.</p>
<p>By this time, the procedure in negotiating Indian treaties had become
fairly stereotyped. The Indians were gathered together by agents who made
glowing promises of good things to come. At the meeting place preparations
were made for feeding great numbers of people; traders were encouraged to
attend with attractive selections of goods, numerous barrels of whiskey were
imported; and every precaution was taken to satisfy the appetites and desires
of the Indians. At the proper time the agent in charge assembled the braves,
to whom he read a stilted and pompous message from the Great White Father
in which the Indians were upbraided for their depredations, drunkenness,
and other misconduct, and reminded of the forbearance, generosity, and
friendliness of the whites. Then the Indians were asked what lands they
would surrender and if they would move farther west.</p>
<p>Neither the Miamis nor the Potawatomies wanted to leave their lands
in 1826, but after food and whiskey had been consumed and goods given out
to the value of $61,588, they showed signs of weakening. However, it was
apparent that the commissioners could get nowhere unless they could secure
the support of the traders. The latter desired to have their claims&mdash;sometimes
two or three times the actual amount of credit they had extended
to the Indians&mdash;allowed and paid for out of the annuities. They also wished
to gain control of more desirable land through the treaty, thus obtaining it
without the land being put up at public auction as was the legal requirement.</p>
<p>There had grown up in the administration of Indian affairs a way of
passing Indian lands to the whites without subjecting them to the land laws of
the United States. The proper legal procedure of land disposal was for the
Indians to cede land to the United States, whereupon it became subject to the
administration of the General Land Office. The land would then be surveyed
and sold at auction to the highest bidder. The remaining land was sold for
$1.25 an acre. This method was fair and democratic. The nonstatutory
method of land disposal worked in this way; trader and Indian agents, who
generally cooperated closely with one another, would include in the Indian
treaties provisions authorizing the patenting of certain lands to the chiefs,
half-breeds, or ordinary members of the tribes. In turn these individuals
conveyed their rights to traders in payment of real or imaginary debts before
the treaty was signed or shortly thereafter. Although presidential approval
for such conveyances was necessary, in most cases the approval could be
secured easily, provided the agents would report that the Indians had
received a fair price for their land. As the agents were either under obligation
to the traders for support in treaty negotiations or were personally interested
in some of the reserves, they could usually be induced to send in a favorable
report even though the Indians might have bartered their land away for some
trinkets or a few drinks.</p>
<p>The Ewings, Hanna, Coquillard, Hamilton, Taber, Tipton, and
Vermilya, all acquired interests in individual reserves to the amount of
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
thousands of acres. All of these men were involved in the promotion of
certain projects (towns, roads, canals) for which their land was valuable.</p>
<p>Thus we see the traders were in full force at the treaty grounds in 1826,
fighting for their interests. They worked through the chiefs and headmen of
the tribes to whom they gave gifts and loans. To take care of the traders
claims, present and prospective, it was necessary to increase the annuities
and agree to pay the Indian debts. In addition, goods to the value of $41,259
were to be distributed to the Miamis for two years following the treaty. For
these stipulations the Indians surrendered 976,000 acres, the main part of
which was along the Wabash and Maumee rivers. From this cession, the
Miamis were permitted to retain 81,800 acres for special groups and 13,920
for individual reserves.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_3" href="#fn_7_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The primary importance of this treaty, aside from the surrender of land
wanted by actual settlers, is that it opened the way for the construction of the
Wabash and Erie canal. The treaty of 1826 and the enlarged annuities it
provided also made the ultimate removal of the Indians from this area even
more difficult. The frontier community of Fort Wayne could not be
disdainful of payments of specie which ran as high as $100,000 in some
years. The payments of annuities, the distribution of gifts bought from
traders and the assumption of Indian debts were followed by a period of
prosperity for agents, traders, and land speculators.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that when the people of Fort Wayne learned that Tipton
had applied to the government officials to move the Indian agency from Fort
Wayne, many protested vigorously. For a long time, Tipton had desired to
remove the agency to a more central location in the Indian country. The
exploitation of the Indians at Fort Wayne was reason enough, but Tipton had
to wait for a while as the opposition was too strong. The attitude of the
traders at the treaty of 1826 gave Tipton plenty of excuse to push the project
of removal once more. In a letter written February 7, 1827, which eventually
found its way onto the Senate floor, Tipton listed seven reasons why the
agency should be removed from Fort Wayne.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_4" href="#fn_7_4">[4]</a> Not only was the agency too
remote from the Indians, argued Tipton, but it was also too close to
numerous grog shops and to the traders who sold his wards whiskey,
encouraged them to run up debts which must later be deducted from
annuities, and cheated them in a hundred different ways. Tipton cited one
case in which a white woman at Fort Wayne had purchased a shawl from a
drunk squaw for seven apples and 12&frac12; cents. This shawl had cost the squaw
$3.50.</p>
<p>Since the removal of the Indian agency would destroy their highly
lucrative business, the traders at Fort Wayne put aside petty quarrels and
joined in common defense to prevent it. John McCorkle, as a principal
owner of real estate at Fort Wayne, wrote to Representative William McLean
from Indiana:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This settlement has been formed in consequence of the establishment of
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
the agency at that place. Reserves were made for the use of the agent,
thereby holding out a guarantee to the purchasers of public lands and
property, that this agency would be continued at that place until the
Indians should be removed from that country. Among others, I became a
considerable purchaser of considerable public lands, for which I paid an
extravagant price. One tract, near and adjoining the reservation for the
agency, I paid $26 per acre for.... If a removal should take place, the
Indians, as well as the inhabitants at Wayne, who have expended their all
there, will be greatly disobliged.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_5" href="#fn_7_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from an earlier letter of McCorkle to Tipton, the former
believed that the agent had misled him at the time the Fort Wayne lands were
sold by the government. McCorkle sincerely believed that the agency would
remain at Fort Wayne when he purchased the original plat.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_6" href="#fn_7_6">[6]</a> After the agency
was removed from Fort Wayne, McCorkle and Tipton became bitter
enemies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some traders at Fort Wayne raised the old cry of mismanagement
and misuse of government funds and sought the dismissal
of Tipton. Tipton&rsquo;s perennial enemies&mdash;Robert Hood, Benjamin
Cushman, and Elisha Harris&mdash;brought five charges of misconduct
against Tipton before the Secretary of War, James Barbour.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_7" href="#fn_7_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In answering these charges Tipton wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is improper for a man to speak of his neighbours faults
and follies, yet both self defence and truth Justifies the assertion that a
majority of the Citizens of this village are of the lowest order of society,
such as discharged soldiers and dishonourable men. In this latter
class is Robert Hood, Ben Cushman and Elisha B. Harris, who have
fled from the offended laws of their Country elsewhere and have stopped
here on account of the quantity of money annualy disbursed at this
place. Their constant practice is to get money from the Indians by
every artifice in their power ... we should not be surprised at the unexampled
exertion made to oust me, when we reflect on fate of all my
predecessors that Wells and Turner were dismissed, Stickney put out
by address, and M. Hays almost compelled by the society here to resign.
The superintendant knows me and is not wholy unacquainted with
the character of a part of the inhabitants of this village.... He can
satisfy you what kind of people I have to deal with.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_8" href="#fn_7_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elisha Harris, one of the men who filed charges against Tipton,
had a very questionable record. He was indicted several times for stealing
horses from the Indians. The other men, Cushman and Hood, who
filed the charges against Tipton, were both elected judges of Allen
county and apparently had some standing in the community. Cushman
was indicted once for carrying concealed weapons, but he was never
convicted on any charge. Indeed there were few leading men in the
county who escaped being brought before the court. Subpoenas were
served on the Ewings, Suttenfield, and others. Nor was Tipton innocent
of all charges. His enemies could truthfully say that he had used his
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
position as Indian agent to gain control of some of the most valuable
land in northern Indiana, but this they would not do, as they would expose
themselves also.</p>
<p>Despite the vigorous protests and charges leveled against him, Tipton
was able to accomplish his purpose, the removal of the Indian agency from
Fort Wayne. Through the controversy, Tipton was supported by Lewis Cass,
his immediate superior, who in this instance became convinced that the
welfare of the Indians and the greater convenience of Tipton required
removal. With Cass&rsquo; influence on his side, the transfer was authorized on
March 14, 1828.</p>
<p>Tipton had a personal interest in securing the removal of the agency to a
spot near the junction of the Wabash and Eel rivers. He and his friends were
able to lay out to the best advantage and to buy control of the Indian reserves
there. Shortly thereafter, Tipton and his associates established the town of
Logansport. The new town attracted many of those traders whose prosperity
depended on the Indian annuities, among them being Cyrus Taber and one
member of the Ewing firm, George W. Ewing. Whiskey became as plentiful
at Logansport as at Fort Wayne, and the Indians were persuaded to
overpurchase as often and defrauded as badly. One can hardly see what
benefit had been attained by the removal of the agency to Logansport other
than the enrichment of Tipton and his associates.</p>
<p>Although the Indians failed to secure any benefits from the removal of
the agency, actually it produced a blessing in disguise for the village of Fort
Wayne. While the change was not immediately apparent, the removal of the
agency meant that the town would secure a higher type of settler than before,
and that its growth would depend more on its own natural advantages and
industry than on the artificial boom of the annuity payments. Most important
of all, the removal of the agency turned the attention of the villagers to new
enterprises. Chief among these was the construction of the Wabash-Erie
canal, which proved the means by which Fort Wayne achieved a new and
more permanent reason for existence. The removal of the Indians in 1826
had made the land available for the canal. Now the removal of the Indian
agency indirectly resulted in local enthusiasm for its construction.</p>
<p>On the other hand the agency played an important role in the early
development of Fort Wayne. While it was in existence here, the agency
attracted many men to this area, such as Hanna, Comparet, and the Ewings,
who later remained to build a city. The Indian agency also contributed
indirectly to the ultimate construction of the canal. Many of the leading
traders, in particular Samuel Hanna, had secured by means of trading with
the Indians the choice lands they hoped to develop through the construction
of the canal. Consequently, they vigorously championed the Wabash-Erie
canal program.</p>
<p>For a short time after the principal Indian agency had been removed, a
sub-agency was maintained at Fort Wayne with Samuel Lewis and Abel C.
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
Pepper in charge. When, on December 30, 1829, Pepper reported that the
public buildings were in such a state of decay that a hundred dollars would be
needed to repair them, the government officials determined to discontinue
even the sub-agency.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_9" href="#fn_7_9">[9]</a> Thus early in 1830, Congress authorized the sale of
the public lands yet retained by the government at Fort Wayne. This act
sounded the death-knell of the old fort, which was purchased by a land
company from New Haven, Connecticut. The other twenty acres were
purchased by the county.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
